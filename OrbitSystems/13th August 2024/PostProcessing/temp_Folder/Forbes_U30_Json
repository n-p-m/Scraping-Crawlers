In Sunday's series finale against the Tampa Bay Rays, the shortstop went 3-for-4 with four stolen bases, bringing him up to 55 so far in 2024.\nAccording to OptaSTATS, De La Cruz is just the fifth MLB player since 1901 to reach 70 runs and 55 stolen bases before the end of July. The last player to achieve the feat was Rickey Henderson in 1988.\nBeing mentioned in the same breath as Henderson is always notable, especially when it comes to stealing bases. The Hall of Famer stole more bases than anyone in the history of major league baseball, on top of being an elite leadoff hitter.\nDe La Cruz has been setting records of his own ever since breaking into the big leagues in June 2023. Just last week, he became the first player ever to record 80 extra-base hits, 80 stolen bases and 80 walks through 200 career games.\nThe 22-year-old made his first All-Star appearance earlier this month, and there could be many more in his future if he keeps up this kind of production.\nDe La Cruz is on pace for 84 stolen bases this season, a height that hasn't been reached since Henderson's 1988 campaign. The 20-80 club currently has just two members \u00e2\u00c2 Henderson and Eric Davis \u00e2\u00c2 and De La Cruz could be joining them in short order.\nFollow Fastball on FanNation on social media\nContinue to follow our FanNation on SI coverage on social media by liking us on\u00c2 Facebook\u00c2 and by following us on Twitter\u00c2 @FastballFN.\nYou can also follow Sam Connon on Twitter\u00c2 @SamConnon.",

He ranks in the 86th percentile in terms of barrel percentage and has showcased most of his power against right handed pitching.\u00c2\nDe La Cruz is hitting .276 with a .536 slugging percentage and 13 homers against righties, which is notable against a soft-tossing Jameson Taillon. Further, he\u00e2s playing at Great American Ball Park on Monday, where he has .277/.373/.511 slashes with 10 home runs on the season.\u00c2\nThis is all setting up for a big outing from the Reds\u00e2 young star, including a home run.\u00c2\nRoyce Lewis\nLewis struggles to stay on the field, he only has 98 at bats on the season as he has spent more time on the injured list than off of it, but when he is in the lineup, he produces.\u00c2\nThe third baseman is hitting .296 with 11 home runs in 27 games, and destroys lefty pitchers. Lewis is hitting .429 against southpaws with three home runs and faces Jose Quintanta on Monday, who has an xERA of 5.22 and a hard hit percentage that ranks in the 18th percentile.\u00c2\nGive me Lewis at this price tag to go deep.\u00c2\nLourdes Gurriel\nA staple of the Daily Dinger column when he faces a lefty, Gurriel is worth a bet on Monday with his dominance of left handed pitching.\u00c2\nWith slashes of .331/.352/.508 against southpaws, Gurriel has been a terror for lefty pitchers. He has only five home runs against lefties, but he has seen far less at bats against them rather than righties, 118 vs. 272.\u00c2\nAgainst Mitchell Parker, who has allowed plenty of power to righties, 12 home runs on the year, this can be a prime matchup for Gurriel.\u00c2\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.",

Wade, Burrow took to Instagram to share that he was in support of a woman's right to choose when it comes to abortion rights.\nHe also spoke about gun control when asked about it at a press conference that same summer.\nEarlier this offseason, Burrow and teammate Sam Hubbard attended UFC 299 in Miami and were spotted posing for a photo with former president Donald Trump.",

        "article": "Cincinnati Bengals Practice Takeaways: Joe Burrow Continues to Shine, Young Weapons Make Impact\nCINCINNATI \u00e2 The Bengals wrapped up their first day of padded practice on Tuesday afternoon.\nGuys like Ja'Marr Chase and Trey Hendrickson didn't participate, but that doesn't mean that we don't have plenty of observations from the session.\nHere are our practice takeaways from Tuesday:\nJoe Sheisty\nJoe Burrow continues to look like Joe Burrow. He connected with a plethora of different targets during team drills, including Charlie Jones, Mike Gesicki, Shedrick Jackson, Trenton Irwin and Andrei Iosivas.\nThat's the benefit of not having Chase out there. Tee Higgins did practice, but Burrow spread the ball around, which not only helps the offense, but it helps a young secondary that continues to grow.\nBurrow has checked every box that the Bengals could have hoped during the first week of training camp and Tuesday's first padded session was another step in the right direction.\nYoung Weapons\nCharlie Jones had his best training camp practice. He caught a touchdown from Burrow in team drills and had multiple receptions throughout the session.\nAndrei Iosivas had a couple of drops, but rebounded and had two catches in 11-on-11s down the stretch to salvage the day. The second-year pro has been a standout at wide receiver during the first week, moving into the slot for the first time in his career.\nBoth Jones and Iosivas took big steps forward this offseason and it's showing in practice.\nRookie Shines\nThe pads were kind to rookie offensive tackle Amarius Mims. The 21-year-old is working exclusively with the first-team offense with Trent Brown (tightness) on the NFI list. The Bengals' first round pick has made the most of his opportunity up to this point.\nMims was dominant on Tuesday, towering over Myles Murphy in passing situations. His strength, physicality and athleticism were on full display.\nThere will be ups and downs for the rookie, but people in the building have praised his work ethic. Mims has all of the physical traits in the world and is off to an impressive start in training camp. It's a great sign for the present and the future of the Bengals' offensive line.\nOther Notes\nDax Hill and DJ Turner II continue to battle for the starting cornerback job. Hill had a nice pass breakup in the endzone while guarding Iosivas on Tuesday. Both guys have given up plays, but also flashed their potential during the first week of camp.\nThe punter battle between Brad Robbins, Austin McNamara and Ryan Rehkow is just getting started. McNamara and Rehkow have done all of the punting during team periods over the past few sessions. Robbins is hoping to hold off both rookies and win the job after an up-and-down rookie season.\nFor more on the Bengals,\u00c2 subscribe to our YouTube Channel and watch the video below:\nMake sure you\u00c2 bookmark BengalsTalk.com\u00c2 for the latest Bengals news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more!\nYou May Also Like:\nLook: Bengals Star Joe Burrow Walks in Vogue Fashion Show in Paris\nWatch: Bengals Star Trey Hendrickson Holds Kids Camp\nJosh Newton Discusses\u00c2 What's\u00c2 Fueled His Journey to NFL:\u00c2 'One Offer Coming Out of High School'\nWatch: Joe Burrow Chats With Jared Leto During Fashion Week in Paris\nDJ Turner II Ready to Attack Second NFL Season:\u00c2 'I Just Left Some Plays on The Field'\nWatch: Best of Joe\u00c2 Burrow's\u00c2 2024 Offseason\nDax Hill Brewing in Lou\u00c2 Anarumo's\u00c2 Lab, Bengals Hope Former First Rounder Makes Successful Switch to Cornerback\nThe Athletic Picks Bengals Win Total as a Best Bet for 2024 Season\nBengals Star Orlando Brown Jr. Posts Heartfelt Message to His Dad on\u00c2 Father\u00e2s\u00c2 Day\nA Pleasant Surprise: Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins Signing Franchise Tender\nZac Taylor Praises\u00c2 Ja'Marr\u00c2 Chase, Explains Why He\u00c2 Didn't\u00c2 Do Much During Bengals Mandatory Minicamp\nPFF Names Chase Brown, Jordan Battle on 2024 All-Breakout Team\nPFF Ranks Geno Stone Among Top-20 NFL Safeties\nSheldon Rankins Details Return For OTAs:\u00c2 'Wanted To Make Sure I Got Back Out Here'\n-----\nJoin the\u00c2 44,000+ Bengals fans that subscribe to us on YouTube.\nFollow us on Twitter:\u00c2 @BengalsTalkSI\nSubscribe and follow the ONLY Daily Bengals Podcast",

The more we continue to invest in stuff like this, the more comfortable the players are going to be. We're going to love coming into work. I'm really happy with it. It's quite an upgrade. Credit to ownership for putting this all together.\"\nBack in February, the NFL Players Association polled players from every team and had them assign grades to specific aspects of their teams. The Bengals' locker room was given a D+, which was 24th in the league.\nIn addition to the low locker room grade, the Bengals got an F- in treatment of families, food/cafeteria and nutritionist/dietician. Their overall grade placed them 26th out of the 32 NFL teams.\nWhile certain aspects of the organization have needed some work, the Bengals' on-field product has been quite good in recent years.\nIn 2020 and 2021, Cincinnati reached the AFC Championship Game in back-to-back seasons. That included reaching the Super Bowl in 2020 where it fell just short of winning a championship against the Los Angeles Rams.\nOver the course of those two seasons, Burrow established himself as one of the NFL's top quarterbacks, and he earned a five-year, $275 million contract extension.\nExpectations were high for Burrow and the Bengals again last season, but a wrist injury limited the superstar signal-caller to just 10 games.\nBackup Jake Browning performed admirably in Burrow's absence, but the Bengals narrowly missed the playoffs with a 9-8 record.\nWith Burrow back healthy for the 2024 season, the Bengals are once again viewed as one of the top contenders to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl.",

But in the past, the third week of the preseason has been when teams usually give starters some run (though even that has started to change now that there are only three exhibitions each preseason).\nTo add on to that disclaimer, everything would need to keep going well for Burrow between now and then, too. So far, he's looked like his usual self (minus the \"Slim Sheisty\" look, anyway) and has offered no hints of issues with the surgically repaired wrist.\nAnd with that comment, Taylor has made every preseason game more interesting than usual for Bengals fans.\nZac Taylor speaks to the media https://t.co/SZ5Em6txEQ\n\u2014 Cincinnati Bengals (@Bengals) August 1, 2024\nMore Latest News!\nBengals injury updates on Trey Hendrickson and Sam Hubbard are interesting\nExpert thinks a Ja'Marr Chase extension could happen soon\nEvery player on Bengals' roster bubble after the first week of training camp\nThis article originally appeared on Bengals Wire: Zac Taylor surprsies with Joe Burrow's possible preseason debut date",

Burrow earned the No. 39 spot and Tagovailoa held the No. 36 spot on the countdown, which was voted on by players.\nSharp Football Analysis @SharpFBAnalysisThe <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLTop100?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NFLTop100</a> 40-31:<br><br>\u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/DRAlMq37gB\">https://t.co/DRAlMq37gB</a> <br><br>40.

When healthy, Burrow completed 66.8 percent of his passes for 2,309 yards and 15 touchdowns compared to six interceptions.\nWith offseason additions on the offensive line including Trent Brown and Amarius Mims in free agency as well as the draft, Burrow could rise up the list once again if he's able to stay on the field in 2024.\nMeanwhile, Tagovailoa saw an improvement in his placement on the list after he earned the No. 82 spot on the 2023 rankings. It's been an eventful summer for the signal-caller, as he also received a massive four-year extension worth $212.4 million from Miami on Friday.\nTagovailoa helped lead the Dolphins to a commendable 11-6 record in 2023, helping the team earn consecutive playoff appearances for the first time since 2001. The 26-year-old earned the first Pro Bowl nod of his career by amassing a league-leading 4,624 passing yards to go along with 29 touchdowns.\nBurrow and Tagovailoa were both selected within the first five picks of the 2020 NFL draft, and they're still not far apart in the 2024 top 100 players list.",

        "article": "Joe Burrow Highlights Young Receiver Development Without Ja'Marr Chase at Training Camp\nCINCINNATI \u00e2\u00c2 Joe Burrow caught up with the NFL Network crew after Monday's training camp practice. Burrow is working through his offseason rust early in training camp without his top option. Ja'Marr Chase hasn't been out there to catch his passes, so the young guys have had to step up early.\nHe dove into their development.\n\"I feel great about how our young guys are coming along right now,\" Burrow said. \"There's a lot of young receivers that we've drafted over the last couple of years that are having big camps, that we're gonna count on a lot this year. Like you said, Andrei (Iosivas) Trenton (Irwin), Jermaine (Burton), those guys are gonna have to step up. We lost TB (Tyler Boyd) in the slot so they're not going to replace him with one guy. We're going to replace him with a bunch of different guys that have a bunch of different skill sets and they're really coming along.\"\nChase is still at the top of Burrow's mind\u00c2 though\u00c2 as\u00c2 he cements a\u00c2 stronger\u00c2 and stronger relationship with his top receiver.\n\"It's priceless,\" Burrow said about their relationship. \"We have a kind of relationship that we can talk through just about anything on or off the field. And when you have that kind of relationship, it makes creating that chemistry and building that chemistry that much easier on the field and I think it shows on Sunday.\"\nThe chemistry building continues in Cincinnati.\n\"I feel great. I'm excited about where I'm at,\" Burrow said about his health. \"I think we have a great plan to keep me healthy through this training camp. Feeling as good as I can into week one. And feeling really good, getting better day-by-day. That's what training camp is for, anytime you're coming back from injury that there's hurdles that you want to get over and we're clearing those.\"\nBookmark Bengals Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns\u00c2 and\u00c2 so much\u00c2 more!\u00c2 For more on the Bengals,\u00c2 subscribe to our YouTube Channel.\nYou May Also Like:\nZac Taylor Notes Joe Burrow is Bigger Entering Training Camp: 'I Think It's a Good Thing'\nZac Taylor Dives Into Trent Brown Entering Training Camp on NFI: 'Just Trying to be Smart'\nBengals Wide Receiver Ja'Marr Chase Refuses to Say Patrick Mahomes' Name During NFL Top 100 Interview\nESPN Takes Bengals to Task For Not Extending Ja'Marr Chase: Mike Brown is 'Absolutely Robbing Him'\nFive Cincinnati Bengals Players Entering Training Camp on Roster Bubble\nLook: Trey Hendrickson Makes NFL 100 List for Fourth Consecutive Season\nUndisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes Has Message for Bengals QB Joe Burrow\nTim Krumrie on 2024 Bengals Ring of Honor Induction: Remember me as 'Mentally Toughest Guy Who Ever Played'\nNational Analyst Believes Joe Burrow Too High in Latest Quarterback Rankings\nIt's Official: Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins Will Play on Franchise Tag in 2024\nSports Illustrated Predicts Bengals Win One Super Bowl Over Next Five Seasons\nLook: Ted Karras Takes Photo in Front of Cordell Volson's Hometown Sign\nCBS Sports Ranks Zac Taylor Among League's Top-10 Big-Game Coaches\nLook: Bengals Remind Everyone How Close We Are to the NFL Regular Season\nCBS Sports Names Ted Karras Bengals' Unsung Player\nESPN Ranks Bengals' Under-25 Talent Outside NFL's Top 15\nWatch: Sam Hubbard Throws Out First Pitch Ahead of Reds' Matchup With Tigers\n-----\nBe sure to keep it locked on All Bengals all the time!\nSubscribe to the All Bengals YouTube channel\nFollow AllBengals on Twitter:\u00c2 @AllBengals\nSubscribe and follow the ONLY Daily Bengals Podcast",

        "article": "Joe Burrow said recently that this is the deepest and most talented receiving corps he has played with since the Cincinnati Bengals drafted him in 2020.\nRookie wide receiver Jermaine Burton, who has impressed during the first week of training camp, is a potential key piece of the Bengals' receiving corps.\nFrom one-handed catches to catching deep balls, Burton has quickly shown why he can be an asset in keeping the Bengals receiving corps one of the best in the NFL.\n\u201cOnce he gets the offense down pat, guys are going to realize he\u2019s a problem.\u201d wide receiver Tee Higgins said after the first training camp practice on Wednesday.\nBurton, a third-round draft pick out of Alabama, is a tantalizing prospect who could help make the Bengals' receiving corps deeper, more versatile, and able to take the top off opposing defenses.\nIn his final season at Alabama, Burton averaged over 20 yards per catch with eight touchdowns. He averaged at least 15 yards per catch in all four seasons of his college career.\nOpposing defenses can double-team Ja\u2019Marr Chase and/or Tee Higgins, but what happens when Burton breaks out?\nSpeaking of, Burton is getting a lot of reps in camp thus far with Chase sidelined. While the Bengals need Chase to win a Super Bowl, getting Burton extended reps will help speed up his development.\nAnd with Higgins likely leaving in 2025, Burton is in prime position to take over the second boundary receiver spot across from Chase.\nAs the wide receiver position continues to grow in value and worth, the Bengals have clearly made Burton part of their all-in investment.\nOne handed catch by rookie Jermaine Burton!\n\u2014 Goodberry (@JoeGoodberry) July 24, 2024\nPosted on the Bengals IG account (edited by me afterwards). pic.twitter.com/xg3ZfnWENM\nJermaine Burton.\n\u2014 Patrick Carey (@PatCareySports) July 27, 2024\nThis man is going to be so much fun in this offense!!! pic.twitter.com/VHNt4WEjhF\nAfter Sunday evening\u2019s practice, a chance for rookies Erick All Jr. and Jermaine Burton to sign for the fans. pic.twitter.com/gZIkhAJlnK\n\u2014 Mike Petraglia (@Trags) July 28, 2024\nFollow us on Twitter and Facebook to get all the latest Cincinnati Bengals news and views.

A draw has a probability of 19.9% and a win for Queretaro has a probability of 16.81%.\nThe most likely scoreline for a FC Cincinnati win is 2-1 with a probability of 9.91%. The next most likely scorelines for that outcome are 2-0 (9.79%) and 1-0 (9.12%). The likeliest drawn scoreline is 1-1 (9.23%), while for a Queretaro win it is 1-2 (4.67%).",

        "article": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - FC Cincinnati co-chief executive officer Jeff Berding said on Monday his club is targeting a specific year to host the MLS All-Star Game.\nColumbus hosted the event at at Lower.com Field last week. Forbes reported that Josh Glessing, Columbus Crew's president of business operations, said hosting the MLS All-Star game, along with week-long festivities, would generate nearly $30 million for the city's economy.\nTQL Stadium has already hosted matches for the 2023 Concacaf Gold Cup, a US Women's National Team match against South Africa last September and the US Men's National Team will take the pitch next month for an International Friendly against New Zealand. It will be the seventh international match to take place at TQL Stadium, the fourth to feature the USMNT.\n\"We have the opportunity to host an All-Star Game, and I think 2027, where we'll have a brand new convention hotel in place, open to be the headquarters hotel for the All-Star Game,\" said Berding. \"Obviously the convention center itself will have completed the modernization plans. We'll be further along on (FC Cincinnati's) plans north of the stadium, and of course by that point, yes, this phase one (of the Central Parkway overhaul) will be completed.\"\nThe city annually hosts the Cincinnati Music Festival -- the biggest urban music festival in the nation -- during the summer and Black Family Reunion every August. It welcomed Taylor Swift's Eras Tour last summer (with an economic impact of approximately $100 million). The MLB All-Star game was played at Great American Ball Park in 2015 and the NCAA Division I men's hockey tournament at US Bank Arena in 2017. Of course, there's also the annual Flying Pig Marathon, and the pro tennis tournaments, though played outside the city in Mason.",

Kivi played soccer from a young age.\n\u00e2Abby Wambach was the player- like I want to be like her,\" Kivi said.\nNow, Kivi is hoping young girls have much better access to seeing players like Wambach.\n\u00e2To see, like, Mia Hamm at soccer camps that I went to and grow up and watch games where Abby Wambach played and iconic players like that,\" she said. \"And having it become so much more accessible than it was back then is would be so cool to see.\u00e2\nWhich is why she\u00e2s been supportive of FC Cincinnati\u00e2s bid to get the next NWSL team to the Queen City.\n\u00e2It always kind of seemed like maybe way in the future we'll get it one day and then something just kind of switch,\" she said. \"And I feel like everyone could see that Cincinnati itself, as a soccer city, was being taken more seriously. We were getting more USA games. FC Cincinnati was really taking off. I think people started to realize that the soccer culture here is so huge and that it's not just a pipe dream, it's a huge possibility.\u00e2\nBetween growing success for FCC, a world-renowned stadium and more and more U.S. games being played here, Kivi thinks Cincinnati has a chance to get the team.\n\u00e2Earlier this year we heard that we were a front-runner for putting in a bid,\" Kivi said. \"So I think the excitement behind that has been huge.\u00e2\nThe cherry on top? U.S. Women\u00e2s National star and Cincinnati native Rose Lavelle has become a champion for the city and its ability to host more high-profile soccer games. Kivi thinks that could play in their favor.\n\u00e2It would be incredible,\" she said. \"She\u00e2s such a good representative of this city. She has so much Cincinnati pride and I think that\u00e2s so cool to see.\u00e2\nWhile the timetable isn\u00e2t clear yet fans will have to just sit back and watch women\u00e2s soccer from the bar across the street from TQL Stadium in the meantime.\nAlong with Cincinnati, Cleveland has also put in a bid for the NWSL team, which would start in 2026. Cleveland\u00e2s biggest hurdle is developing a stadium and training grounds for the team.\nThe Cleveland Soccer Group said they are exploring a training facility and team headquarters at the recently closed Notre Dame College campus, where existing fields would be utilized and more would be built.\nThey\u00e2re looking at a stadium site across from Progressive Field to serve as a bookend for the Gateway District. The cities should find out by the end of the year which one wins the bid.",

        "article": "CINCINNATI (WKRC) - FC Cincinnati have signed defender Ian Murphy to a contract extension through the end of the 2026 season, with an option for 2027, the club announced Thursday.\nMurphy, 24, has made 93 appearances across all competitions for the Orange and Blue since being drafted with the No. 14 overall selection in MLS SuperDraft 2022. Only Luciano \u2018Lucho\u2019 Acosta has made more appearances for FC Cincinnati since the start of Murphy\u2019s rookie season in 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to extend Ian and keep him at the club,\u201d said Chris Albright, FC Cincinnati General Manager. \u201cIan has demonstrated tremendous growth in his three years here, and he\u2019s played a key role in our club\u2019s success since he was drafted. He\u2019s a great teammate and a talented defender, and we\u2019re looking forward to his continued development here with FC Cincinnati.\u201d\nThe 6-foot-2 center back from Redlands, California has made 27 appearances \u2013 23 starts \u2013 across all competitions for the Orange and Blue this season. He has featured in seven clean sheets for the club in 2024.\n\u201cI'm really happy to be here,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cI wanted to stay here, and that was a big thing to me. I really like the city, I love the club and it just means a lot, in my opinion, that FCC have faith in me. That they had the faith in me to draft me and then to give me another contract is a big thing for me. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity and will keep working hard to prove that faith was worth it.\u201d\nMurphy has two career goal contributions for the Orange and Blue, with his lone goal coming on his only career MLS shot on target \u2013 on April 30, 2022 at Toronto FC. His lone assist with FC Cincinnati was a vital one, serving as the match-winning assist on Yerson Mosquera\u2019s stoppage-time winner in the Eastern Conference Semifinals against Philadelphia Union last November.\nIn January, Murphy earned a call up to the United States Men\u2019s National Team\u2019s annual January Training Camp.

        "title": "PREVIEW | FC Cincinnati kick off Leagues Cup 2024 in face off with Quer\u00e9taro FC | FC Cincinnati",
        "article": "The break from regular season action came at a welcome time for FC Cincinnati. After a strong first half of the season, a bad week put a sour taste in everyone's mouth as The Orange and Blue looked to overcome challenges to their health and, therefore, depth. But now the fresh start in Leagues Cup allows for FC Cincinnati to compete and win its mojo back in games that do not impact the clubs regular season.\nFC Cincinnati kick off the 2024 Leagues Cup against Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro FC, needing only a win to guarantee qualification into the knockout stages. NYCFC (the other team in FCC and Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro's group) defeated Los Gallos Blancos in PK's in the first match of group play, meaning any winning result over Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro guarantees moving on.\n\"You look at just the structure alone (of the tournament) and a third of the teams are going after group stage play and not playing games for three weeks. So how do you avoid having that gap in the middle of the season will be, I think, a big talking point,\" FC Cincinnati Head Coach Pat Noonan said Wednesday in a pre match press conference. \"So we can find some solutions there, but it's the challenge that all of us are in. And to avoid that, go win games. That's our approach to it.\"\nQuer\u00c3\u00a9taro FC provides a unique challenge to FC Cincinnati at this point in the season. FCC has never played Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro FC and with Liga MX just four games into the regular season, there is very little data to study about their opponents. But with one match played in Leagues Cup and four Liga MX games there is a basis for Pat Noonan to study from and inform his team.\n\"I think it's a team that plays direct and does it effectively. When you step up your pressure, I think they've taken away risk in terms of trying to play through pressure at times,\" Noonan said of his Thursday opponents. \"A lot of times you'll see five guys along that backline ready to compete for duels and cause you problems with not only the space in behind,but when you're able to win balls or find your midfielders, they do a good job of stepping up and looking to pick up second balls and then attack again.\n\"They compete very well. I know the league form, and the result in the first game against New York City hasn't been of their liking, I'm sure. But they compete well, they have individual talent. They have players that we've seen from MLS prior, with [Lucas] Rodriguez, with [Ake] Loba, [Ronaldo] Cisneros. There's attacking pieces that we're somewhat familiar with, but it was getting guys up to speed with a lot of their individual strengths and what to expect\u00e2\u00a6 There's two different versions of how they press depending on what the scoreline looks like. So those are things that we discussed.\"\nThe need to win is intertwined with regular season success, so FCC will seemingly not toss out a mishmashed lineup and will push for victory to play more matches this month. Last year, FCC found themselves on the wrong end of the first knockout round match and went three weeks without a match\u00e2a challenge FCC players know they do not want to face.\n\"We don't want to have a holiday,\" Yamil Asad said at the press conference. \"We need days to get training\u00e2\u00a6we have new faces on the roster who need time to adapt., need enough time to improve and get to know teammates. International competition is not the same (as league play), but kind of like Concacaf (Champions Cup) it's almost like that. It's going to be good for us.\"\nFC Cincinnati's newest member, Chidozie Awaziem, is expected to be available for selection for the match, and PatNoonan says it's likely the Nigerian center-back will play a role in some way on Thursday. Giving him time to integrate and acclimate himself to the group is vital for long-term success.\n\"It's a (player) in and a position of need. So the challenging part is where he's at physically,\" Noonan said. \"You know, he had a week on his own, a week with the club training before he came here. So that's a short amount of time in terms of building your fitness. So we just have to be really smart with his progress over the coming weeks, but he is available, and I imagine he'll play a role.\"\nFC Cincinnati vs Queretaro FC \u00e2 Thursday August 1, 2024 \u00e2 8 p.m. ET \u00e2 TQL Stadium\nStream: MLS Season Pass on Apple TV\nTV Talent (English, Apple): Steve Cangialosi (PxP), Danny Higginbotham (Analyst)\nTV Talent (Spanish, Apple): Bruno Vain (PXP), Andres Agulla (Analysis)\nRadio: ESPN 1530\nRadio: La Mega 97.7 FM\nRadio Talent (English): Tom Gelehrter (PXP), Kevin McClosky (Analyst)\nRadio Talent (Spanish): Gustavo Luques (PXP), Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Romero (Analyst)\nAbout Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro FC\nFC Cincinnati has never faced Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro FC before, adding a new Liga MX club to the list of all-time opponents that includes Chivas and CF Monterrey.\nFounded in 1950, Los Gallos Blancos (The White Roosters) or Los Albiazules (The White and Blues) started in the lower divisions of the Mexican soccer pyramid and have battled their way up through a vast history of play in Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro City, which is located in the southern part of Mexico. Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro City has a metro population of just over 1.4 million and is known as a World Heritage Site by the United Nations for its historical significance to Mexican culture.\nWhile Los Gallos Blancos have not seen tremendous success in Liga MX or any interaction of Mexico\u00e2s top-flight league, several notable players have taken the field for them, including Brazilian international superstar Ronaldinho and Manchester United star Antonio Valencia. Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro has won two cup competitions in recent years, winning the Copa MX in 2016 and Supercopa MX in 2017, and finishing runners-up in the Liga MX Clausura 2015 season.\nQuer\u00c3\u00a9taro play its home matches at Estadio Corregidora, which opened for the 1986 FIFA World Cup where it hosted four matches. It is designed to fill the stadium capacity of 35,575 in 15 minutes and evacuate the same population in seven minutes. Los Gallos Blancos historically have rivalries with Le\u00c3\u00b3n, Atlas FC and Athl\u00c3\u00a9tico San Luis.\nFC CINCINNATI NOTES\nOutside Regular Season Play \u00e2 Thursday will be FC Cincinnati\u00e2s 25th non-MLS Regular Season match in official competition since joining the league in 2019. FCC are 12-6-6 in the 24 prior matches.\nLucho v Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro \u00e2 Luciano \u00e2Lucho\u00e2 Acosta is the only active FC Cincinnati player to have played against Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro previously in his career. And he has made three appearances against Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro. For D.C. United in the 2015/16 Concacaf Champions League against Los Gallos Blancos, he appeared in both quarterfinal legs as Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro won on aggregate 3-1. He also faced off against them once in 2020 when playing for Liga MX side Atlas FC.\nUndefeated \u00e2 The Orange and Blue won Group Central 3 last year. The club knocked off Sporting Kansas City in a shootout following a dramatic 3-3 draw and Luciano Acosta\u00e2s 90\u00e2+8 equalizer just to send the match to a shootout - which FCC won 4-2. Then, in the second group stage game, FCC defeated Chivas 3-1 in a match which took two days to complete after weather forced a suspension in the 60th minute. FCC fell to eventual Runners-Up Nashville SC in a shootout in the Round of 32.\nOlympian \u00e2 Last week, Miles Robinson was named to the United States roster for the 2024 Summer Olympics beginning later this month in France. Robinson is the first Olympian in FCC history as the U.S. men will compete in the games for the first time since 2008.\nScouting Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro FC (0-4-0, 0 points, 18th in Liga MX Apertura, 0-0-1 in Leagues Cup 2024, D-L-L-L-L)\nThings have not gotten off to a great start in the new season for Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro FC in league play. After a PK defeat to NYCFC in the opening match of East Group 1, the Roosters need a positive result to keep their hopes in League Cup 2024 alive.\nDefeats to Monterrey, Chivas, Club America and Tijuana have not made for an easy early start to the Apertura season, but with just three goals in four games while conceding nine has made it a particularly frustrating start. Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro played NYCFC to a scoreless draw in the opening match, but were shelled by New York to the tune of 19 shots to 10 and 66% possession for the host NYCFC.\nFormer player Mauro Gerk is the manager for Queretaro and has managed the side since 2022. In his playing days, the Argentine striker, who won top goalscorer in 2008, played 116 games for the Roosters from 2005 to 2009. As a manager, he led two Argentine clubs (the Racing Club reserves and Defensa y Justicia reserves) before taking over the first team in Queretaro.\nIn the opening match of Leagues Cup, Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro deployed a 5-4-1 formation with goalkeeper Guillermo Allison in net. Allison, 33, was a long time member of fellow Liga MX side Cruz Azul but joined the Rooster last season to become the starter. Since then he\u00e2s made 24 league starts and conceded 36 goals.\nAt the striker spot was former Nashville SC player Ak\u00c3\u00a9 Loba, who has made just one start prior for them in the league this season. The midfield was comprised of Argentines Federico L\u00c3\u00a9rtora, Mart\u00c3n Rio and Lucas Rodr\u00c3guez, and native Mexican Alan Medina. Rodriguez played one season in MLS in 2019 where he was teammates with Luciano Acosta on D.C. United. The defensive backline consisted of Bryton Vazquez (who made the jump from rival club Atlas two years ago), Kevin Escamilla (the veteran of the group in his 11th Liga MX year), Franco Russo and Ecuadorian stars Jonathan Perlaza and Ayrton Preciado.\nVeteran leader Pablo Barrera, who, at 37, has started all four of their league matches, came on as a sub in their first League Cup match, though. The midfielder is most known for his stint with West Ham in the English Premier League. 35-year-old Omar Mendoza also played all four league matches but did not start in the NYCFC match.\nWith only three goals scored in league play thus far, Barrera leads the team with one goal in a three-way tie with youngsters Samuel Sosa (24) and Victor Lopez (21). Last season (Clasura), Barrera led the team with seven goals, but both runners-up left the club after that season.",

And let's be honest, who doesn't love a good underdog story with unlikely heroes?\nOn Thursday, August 1st, the TQL Stadium will be the stage for an epic battle. FC Cincinnati, enduring a series of defeats in MLS, is ready to turn the tide. With a new defender, Chidozie Awaziem, fresh from Boavista in Portugal, fans have reason to believe the team can rise again. Awaziem is like a knight in shining armor, ready to protect his fortress. And let's not forget Luciano Acosta, the Argentine maestro, who commands the midfield with the precision of a surgeon. Acosta is eyeing his second consecutive MLS MVP award, and his performances so far indicate he's closer than ever to achieving this feat.\nFollow MLS Multiplex on X (Twitter).\nOn the other side of the field, Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro FC doesn't have such a glorious history. They come into the tournament after a string of painful defeats in LIGA MX. But, as they say, sometimes it's in adversity that we find our true strength. Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro may not have the pedigree of giants, but they have heart and a will to win. With experienced players like Ak\u00c3\u00a9 Loba, Ronaldo Cisneros, and Rubio Rub\u00c3n, plus goalkeeper Guillermo Allison, who shone against NYCFC, the Mexican team hopes to surprise.\nCincinnati, despite its recent struggles, still holds a prominent position in the Eastern Conference and the race for the Supporters' Shield. It's a team that has already proven its worth but needs a new push to rediscover its best soccer. The arrival of Awaziem is seen as a potential game-changer. The expected partnership with Miles Robinson, currently representing the USA in the Olympics, promises to strengthen the defense and bring more security to the team.\nOn the other hand, Quer\u00c3\u00a9taro is seeking redemption. After a disastrous start to the season in LIGA MX, the team sees the Leagues Cup as a chance to regain confidence and show they can still be competitive. The team's last victory was in April against Le\u00c3\u00b3n, but hope springs eternal. A win against Cincinnati could be the catalyst they need to turn the tide.\nThis match isn't just a clash of teams; it's a collision of dreams, determination, and a desire to make history. Fans are in for a treat as they witness a battle where every pass, every save, and every goal will echo the heartbeats of these warriors on the field.",

United, explosions in the distance lit up the night sky and the sounds of pops and sizzles rang out through the Washington, D.C. air.\nThose in the stands not from the area were startled and looked to the distance. Fourth of July Fireworks in the nation's capital spilled out from the National Mall and colored the sky with Red, White and Blue. Those on the field, particularly the visiting team, were unaffected. For FC Cincinnati had a one-goal game to win. A type of game The Orange and Blue have become experts at winning and some measly celebratory explosions in the distance could not rattle them.\nPat Noonan said \u00e2It wasn\u00e2t pretty.\u00e2 But it was a win, and that\u00e2s all that matters. Another three points banked for the definitive best team in the league when going away, and another impressive performance (all things considered) for the FCC group who continues to learn how to win and do so with grit, toughness, and poise.\n\u00e2You always want it to look a certain way when you win, but the reality is, with the current state of the group, and where we're at, we have to be pleased with wins,\u00e2 Noonan said of the result postgame. \u00e2Whoever we're playing, whether home or away, at this stage certainly winning is an important part of where we want to be at the end of the year.\u00e2\n\u00e2I give the guys credit, because we've gone on the road two games here and gotten results. It's not easy to do, and I think we have a large enough sample size. I told them before the game to understand \u00e2you guys are a good team on the road, and it might not always be the way we wanted to look.\u00e2 That's credit to the opponent, (but) that's credit to going on the road in tough atmospheres, where you have to be able to adjust at times and adapt to the conditions. I think (we) do a good job of that.\u00e2\nFC Cincinnati has now won 12 one-goal games of the 14 wins they have total this season. Dating back to last season FCC has secured 26 one-goal victories, an MLS record when tabulating a two year stretch. More impressively, perhaps, has been FCC\u00e2s ability to do it on the road. Breaking more records by winning their seventh straight road match and their ninth total on the year, a club record.\nNoonan said the match wasn\u00e2t pretty, but given the context he means that the style of game wasn\u00e2t appealing. With the turf conditions the way they were, both sides battled all night to control the ball in tight spaces, and at times had to double their efforts just to move the ball casually as they would at others fields.\n\u00e2I don't want to make excuses or point things out, but for both teams I think it was challenging with just the condition of the field to be able to move the ball,\u00e2 Noonan clarified. \u00e2I think you saw a lot of guys concentrating on just trying to get a touch right, so that there weren't mistakes. Especially closer to goal.\u00e2\n\u00e2You see it on the first goal we scored, just some of those difficulties that the players face. So, I think maybe that took away from the flow, but you have to be able to adapt, and I thought our guys did a good job of that.\u00e2\nFC Cincinnati, who typically excel when the field is well manicured and allows for quicker, sharp movement from superstars like Luciano Acosta and Luca Orellano, had to smash and grab their way through the direct ball playing D.C. United side who purposely wishes to play that more aerial, over the top style.\nSo FC Cincinnati had to another learn a new way to win, as they have done so many times the last two years. If FCC typically act as a scalpel \u00e2 precise, beautiful movements with devastating, cutting effects \u00e2 on this night they won like a hammer. Smash and Grab style.\n\u00e2I thought (Miles Robinson) was excellent tonight,\u00e2 Noonan said, highlighting one of the key contributors of the win. \u00e2\u00e2\u00e2I think he commanded the back line in a good way, won the majority of his aerial duels, and then had purpose with where the headers were going. Because the reality is he's got [Jacob] Murrell on him who's a tough forward to deal with. Using his body well, gave us a lot of advantages in those moments, and I think good composure at times (when) tracking runners behind.\u00e2\n\u00e2All around, I think, excellent, and his fitness looked like he hadn't missed a beat. That's tough considering he hasn't had a game in about a month.\u00e2\nRobinson, back with FC Cincinnati after his stint with the US Men\u00e2s National Team at the CONMEBOL Copa America, arrived in D.C. with FCC on Tuesday night and missed all the prep work done in the build up to Wednesday night\u00e2s match. But the center back, when he met with coaches upon arrival, told them he wanted to play and was ready to play and got to work studying what he could. Robinson did not feature in any of the American\u00e2s three group stage games or two friendlies in the build up to the event, but said the staff with the USMNT makes sure everyone in camp is in excellent fitness, so physical prep never ended up being a problem.\n\u00e2I think we all knew the type of game it was going to be,\u00e2 Robinson said postgame. \u00e2It's going to be chaotic and given the team that we're playing and how they like to play and the conditions of the field and things like that, I think it took me a bit to kind of get acclimated to the game\u00e2\u00a6but I think in general, we played well enough to get a win and I think that's what's most important.\u00e2\nThe return of the now two-time MLS All-Star to the back line fundamentally changes how FCC can plot for matches, both now and in the future. He was always expected back, but with the results at Copa America not going the USA\u00e2s way, FCC is the beneficiary as the quality Robinson provides was on full display all night long. And while Robinson self-critiqued by blaming the first goal for D.C. United on himself and pointed to that as a place to get better, having Robinson back is certainly a welcome addition.\n\u00e2When you have players like Miles\u00e2\u00a6their decision making and their communication and how they read the game typically helps to make their teammates look stronger,\u00e2 Nooan said. \u00e2Sometimes, it's just a confidence boost to have guys like that next to you, and Miles played a part in that.\u00e2\nPavel Bucha was another contributor to the winning effort, dominating in all parts of the field and being rewarded for his efforts with his first brace with the club. The Czech midfielder has been a fundamental part of what has made FC Cincinnati successful in 2024. He plays just about every minute of every game, is reliable on defense and can progress through the middle of the field both with passes and off the dribble in 1-on-1 situations. He can, in effect, blend in with whatever style is needed of him. On this night, both of his goals (one scored in the 39 minute and the other the 63) came by result of tenacity being rewarded.\nGoal number one comes after Bucha had already done all the hard work of building the play opportunity through the midfield from FCC's side of the field, fighting through multiple tackles from defenders to intercept him. The initial attempt eventually is turned over, but Bucha doesn\u00e2t quit, FCC wins the ball back and eventually Luca Orellano combines with Bucha for a brilliant bit of passing and finishing.\nGoal number two is simpler but ideologically similar. Bucha joins the attack with recently subbed on Sergio Santos and Yamil Asad up the left wing and makes what could have been a thankless run through the middle in an open channel. At the very least his run spreads the defense. But Asad finds him in space and Bucha puts home a lovely finish past the D.C. keeper.\n\u00e2We look at different ways to get (Bucha) advancing into the box, and it's not always going to look the same, but in moments where we get our wing backs in wider positions, and maybe we have a nine opposite side of the field. If there's moments where he can advance, especially when Lucho [Acosta] is on the left side, and almost plays as a second attacking midfielder, and then understand the timing of how to run in behind into goal. That's something that we thought he was capable of and could help us score goals in that fashion. And I thought, in different ways, that was the two goals that he scored tonight,\u00e2 Noonan explains. \u00e2It's how he advances into these spaces and understands, depending on the positioning of Lucho, how he needs to have a presence higher up the field, and how he can get us moving to goal with those deeper runs.\u00e2\nFC Cincinnati continues to find ways to win. Even when it isn\u00e2t pretty or when the style of play may be less suitable to them, they unite and find a way to come together. Part of that, in the spirit of the Smash and Grab ideological understanding of tonight's match, requires sacrifice though.\nKipp Keller, who started at center back for this match, rolled his ankle in the 46 minute after D.C. United player tried to box him out while setting up for a corner kick. Keller clearly felt pain as he limped around the field in the aftermath and the coaching staff began to look for a substitute to replace him.\nBut he, like others who suffered in silence, battled through the pain or discomfort for as long as he could. Noonan highlighted post game that Keller, along with Ian Murphy and being mindful of other subs while rotating for fitness level, deserved credit for toughing it out.\n\u00e2\u00e2\u00e2These guys, a lot of them have a high pain tolerance, and (they) don\u00e2t want to come off the field,\u00e2 Noonan said. \u00e2(But) it's something that we need to get right with cramping, with playing through discomfort. And that's not to say that the guys weren't ready to play through discomfort, it's just where we're at along our back line and trying to eliminate injuries in this busy period. Kipp's was, \u00e2how long can you go?\u00e2 And if you can't go anymore\u00e2\u00a6then we have guys that can step in.\u00e2\nFC Cincinnati now turn their attention to a significant weekend match with Supporters\u00e2 Shield-leading Inter Miami CF, who despite being without key stars have continued to be dominant and also find ways to win games. Technically speaking, FCC leads on points per game and has a game in hand over Miami, but regardless this is just one of two times the clubs will meet this season and a victory over the south Florida side would flip the league upside down.\nAt times in this game it felt like there was one eye to the future in Wednesday\u00e2s game. Key pieces like Luca Orellano, Kevin Kelsy and Dado Valenzuela were substituted out early. Orellano is one yellow card away from suspension so his early exit ensures participation in the weekend match, and with Kelsy and Valenzula starting over Santos and (more specifically) Yuya Kubo, all four forwards will be fresher than they would have had they played a full 90 minutes.\nRegardless, FCC again has to turn the page quickly and adapt in just two days' time. But so does Miami, and with road performances feeling comfortable for FCC, a massive home opportunity awaits next.\n\u00e2Both teams are in good form, and certainly playing with confidence,\u00e2 Noonan closed with.",

        "title": "Is Miles Robinson Ready to Lead FC Cincinnati\u2019s Defense? - Cincinnati Magazine",
        "article": "The past two months of Miles Robinson\u2019s 2024 seasons have resembled the past few years for the 27-year-old center back: some highs, some lows, and uncertainty for the future. An afterthought in the U.S. Men\u2019s National Team\u2019s brief Copa America campaign, he could captain the Americans in the Olympic Games later this month. After thriving in a supporting role in his first year on FC Cincinnati\u2019s backline, injuries have forced him into a starring role, with mixed results. And I\u2019m still not sure how Robinson, who was once a no-brainer USMNT starter and one of MLS\u2019s top talents, ended up leaving Atlanta for Cincinnati and not Europe.\nFollowing FCC\u2019s 2-0 home loss to Nashville on May 29, Robinson joined up with the USMNT for Copa, surely anticipating minutes and a run to the knockout stages as the U.S. hosted the world\u2019s longest-running continental soccer tournament. As it turns out, the Stars and Stripes went three-and-out and Robinson failed to see any minutes over two friendlies and the group stage matches.\nJust over two weeks into his absence, 2023 MLS Defender of the Year Matt Miazga was injured in a collision with a goal post. Eleven days later, the club\u2019s de facto defensive captain was ruled out for the season. On July 3, Robinson rejoined FC Cincinnati to play his first match minutes in exactly five weeks.\nIn his return against D.C. United, Robinson started in Miazga\u2019s typical place in the middle of the back line and went the full 90 minutes despite zero training time to get acclimated to his new role as FCC\u2019s defensive quarterback. FC Cincinnati allowed two goals but prevailed 3-2 for its 12th one-goal triumph of 2024 and 26th one-goal victory since the start the 2023 season, establishing a new league record.\nPost-match at D.C., Head Coach Pat Noonan said Robinson \u201ccommanded the backline in a good way.\u201d The gaffer was similarly complimentary after the club\u2019s 6-1 bushwhacking of Inter Miami on July 8.\nThe good vibes ended with FC Cincinnati\u2019s 3-1 home loss to Charlotte on Saturday night. Not only did the Garys ship three goals, but Robinson picked up a red card in the 72nd minute. He incurred an automatic one-match suspension, ruling him out for tonight\u2019s home tilt vs. Chicago, the last game he could have suited up for prior to leaving for the Olympics in France.\nFCC was already trailing by two with 20 or so minutes remaining when Robinson saw red. Thus, the difference between a 3-1 and 4-1 deficit was negligible, particularly when factoring in his increased importance to the team. Now he won\u2019t be seen in Orange and Blue until August.\nLeadership lessons abroad?\nRobinson is one of three \u201coverage\u201d players the Americans are permitted to select for Olympics, which is an under-23 tournament for men\u2019s teams. Along with Colorado\u2019s Djorde Mihailovic and Nashville\u2019s Walker Zimmerman, Robinson is determined to set an example for his younger teammates.\n\u201cHe\u2019s expecting a leadership role,\u201d he said last week of what U.S. Head Coach Marko Mitrovi\u0107 expects of him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m definitely going to provide that. \u2026 I\u2019m familiar with a lot of the guys on the team and with Walker and Djordje. So I definitely know the team and how a lot of the players like to play and things like that. \u2026 I\u2019m just going to try to provide (Coach) with some confidence in that backline.\u201d\nInternational duty will function as more on-the-job leadership training for Robinson, who shocked many observers (including me) by signing for FC Cincinnati in the offseason. Following a decorated stint in Atlanta in which he won MLS Cup and earned two Best XI honors over six seasons, I thought he\u2019d depart for Europe.\nBut Robinson failed to find any offers and/or clubs that fit his wants and needs, with potential suitors perhaps wary of his form after he ruptured his Achilles in May 2022 and had to skip the World Cup. After starting six matches in 2022 World Cup qualifying, Robinson\u2019s missed World Cup prevented him from showcasing his abilities against the best the world has to offer.\nHis loss was FCC\u2019s gain, though. In early January, Robinson inked a one-year contract (with a club option for 2025) to join what\u2019s been one of the league\u2019s preeminent defenses since Miazga arrived in Cincinnati in August 2022.\nThe U.S. men\u2019s Olympic soccer squad, which is playing in the Olympics for the first time since 2008, begins group play on July 24 against host nation France. The Americans\u2019 last group stage match is on July 30. Should the U.S. fail to advance out of the group stage, Robinson would miss just a single MLS match, July 20 at the New York Red Bulls. FC Cincinnati has a pair of Leagues Cup group stage matches on August 1 and 5.\nFCC technically did not have to release Robinson to the Olympics, but it\u2019s evident there was little to no thought of blocking him from representing his country\u2014particularly since Atlanta blocked past Olympic qualifier call-ups for Robinson. A side benefit for Noonan and the Orange and Blue will be their new defensive commander gaining high-pressure experience abroad.\nWhat comes next\nRobinson will definitely miss another match in Ohio, it just won\u2019t count in the standings: the MLS All-Star Game July 24 in Columbus. He\u2019ll have to rely on Lucho Acosta and Luca Orellano to show out for FC Cincinnati on his behalf.\nOnce Robinson does return, it will be fascinating to see who General Manager Chris Albright brings in to support him along the backline. With Miazga and backup center back Nick Hagglund out for the season, expect at least one additional center back to join up. MLS\u2019s Secondary Transfer Window opens Thursday.\nReinforcements are required if FCC are to contend with the likes of a soon-to-be full strength Inter Miami and an ascending Columbus Crew. The defending champs went into Los Angeles and dismantled West-best LAFC 5-1, scoring at least four times for the fourth time in five matches. FC Cincinnati\u2019s rivals are gaining steam, with the local club needing to supplement its squad to keep pace.\nGrant Freking writes FC Cincinnati coverage for Cincinnati Magazine.

        "title": "USMNT\u2019s Miles Robinson explains why he chose Cincinnati over Europe | FOX Sports",
        "article": "USMNT's Miles Robinson explains why he chose Cincinnati over Europe\nIt's a question that has flummoxed USMNT fans since Miles Robinson signed with FC Cincinnati on Jan. 3: Why would a regular, in-his-prime starter under coach Gregg Berhalter choose to stay in MLS after playing out his contract with Atlanta United instead of moving on a free transfer to a European club?\nWho better to answer it than Robinson himself. Speaking to FOX Sports from the national team's January camp in Florida, the 26-year-old center back \u2014 who was on track to play a major role for the Americans at the 2022 FIFA World Cup before a ruptured Achilles tendon ruled him out of soccer's marquee competition \u2014 explained his reasoning. In short, joining the reigning MLS Supporters Shield winners on a two-year deal worth more than $1.65 million per season made the most sense for several different reasons.\nAtlanta didn't want to lose one of the league's best defenders, offering him a four-year pact two years ago for the same salary \u2014 the MLS maximum for non-designated players. But Robinson was intent on leaving after seven years in Georgia's capital. He preferred to play on grass, for starters, rather than the turf at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which some believe may have contributed to the injury that cost him a World Cup trip.\n\"I really wanted to make some kind of change on and off the field,\" he said. \"Over the course of last season, I talked to a lot of people, just trying to seek advice from any and everyone.\"\n[USMNT transfer news: Cade Cowell reportedly set to join Chivas]\nAmong those was Berhalter who, with the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica now just months away, impressed on Robinson the importance of playing regularly wherever he ended up.\nThere was no guarantee of that overseas. Moving to a European club in the middle of their season is never easy. Besides having to break into an established lineup, there's usually a major adjustment period off the field. It took U.S. striker Ricardo Pepi almost a full year to find his feet across the pond after leaving FC Dallas in early 2022. Another American, midfielder Djordje Mihailovic, never settled at all, returning to MLS this month after a disappointing year at AZ Alkmaar in the Netherlands.\nPSV Eindhoven, the Dutch powerhouse Robinson was linked to throughout the fall, is the runaway Eredivisie leader and will meet German titan Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 next month. Getting minutes there would've been hard at first \u2014 not that things ever got that far. A source told FOX Sports that PSV, where former U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart serves as the director of football \u2014 made it known that it wasn't willing to pay Robinson much more than the $550,000 minimum for players from outside the European Union. That rendered any move there a non-starter.\n\"There wasn't anything completely formal,\" Robinson said when asked if PSV made his camp an offer. \"I never spoke to Earnie.\"\n\"I didn't want to get a pay cut going overseas,\" added Robinson, who earned $1.4 million in Atlanta in 2023. \"As I learned, injuries can happen and you could be out for a year-plus. So the finances were definitely something I took into consideration while making this decision.\"\nBesides, staying in MLS won't necessarily hurt his standing with the national team \u2014 even with Robinson competing against Premier League-ers like Tim Ream and Chris Richards. Where his players are employed isn't the deciding factor for Berhalter. Robinson was a lock during 2022 World Cup qualifying. Fellow MLS veteran Walker Zimmerman started all but one match at the main event in Qatar ahead of Cameron Carter-Vickers, an annual Champions League participant.\nOn a Zoom call with reporters last week, Berhalter said he and his staff would continue to assess Robinson \"the same we do every other player.\"\n\"When you're in camp with players from every league and you show what you can do,\" Robinson said, \"Those moments are very important.\"\n[Related: Miles Robinson headlines USMNT's Olympic-heavy January squad]\nThat's not to suggest that Robinson has shut the door on playing in Europe for good. The agreement he signed in Cincinnati is for just one season with a club option for a second. If Robinson can shut down the likes of Argentina's Lionel Messi, Brazil's Vini Jr. and Uruguay's Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, foreign clubs are certain to take notice.\n\"I definitely have Premier League aspirations,\" Robinson said. \"A one-plus-one [contract] could set me up for the future in terms of my earnings and where I want to go. Betting on myself is definitely something I'm willing to do at this point in my career, especially in a place where I think I can really stand out and help an already-great club take that next step.\"\nDoug McIntyre is a soccer writer for FOX Sports.

        "article": "FC Cincinnati's Ian Murphy has signed a contract extension. Here's what we know\nIan Murphy, one of the success stories within FC Cincinnati's on-field renaissance of the last three seasons, has been rewarded for his role in the club's turnaround.\nMurphy signed a contract extension with FC Cincinnati through 2026 with an option year in 2027, multiple sources confirmed to The Enquirer. FC Cincinnati announced the signing Thursday.\nMurphy started 2024 in the second of three option years on the contract he signed as a rookie. A further option year remained, but FC Cincinnati was able to provide more security than that.\nFC Cincinnati League Cup Can a Leagues Cup match against Quer\u00e9taro F.C. reignite slumping FC Cincinnati?\nFC Cinicannati League Cup Leagues Cup is returning to TQL Stadium. Here's what you need to know\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to extend Ian and keep him at the club,\u201dChris Albright, FC Cincinnati general manager, said in a news release. \u201cIan has demonstrated tremendous growth in his three years here, and he\u2019s played a key role in our club\u2019s success since he was drafted. He\u2019s a great teammate and a talented defender, and we\u2019re looking forward to his continued development here with FC Cincinnati.\u201d\nThe extension offers FC Cincinnati a measure of security at the center back position, which has been stretched thin several times over the last two seasons. Murphy's contract through 2026 ensures that he, 2023 MLS Defender of the Year Matt Miazga, and the recently-acquired Chidozie Awaziem are all scheduled to remain at the club through at least 2025, and possibly longer when factoring for the option years of the latter two players.\nMiles Robinson, a 2024 MLS All-Star, could also be in that mix via a 2025 contract option. And that's just accounting for what FC Cincinnati has publicly announced.\nIn short, FC Cincinnati has experience, elite talent, and depth lined up at center back. Murphy contributes to that equation.\nAdditionally, Murphy has quietly been a steady presence for FC Cincinnati since he was selected in the 2022 MLS SuperDraft first round (No. 14 overall) out of Duke.\nMurphy, 24, has started 52 of his 72 regular-season MLS appearances, including 36 matches over the last two seasons and 19 of 23 matches in 2024.\nWith nine regular-season matches still to play in 2024, Murphy has already logged 1,818 minutes \u2212 a career high that surpassed his previous best of 1,522 minutes in 2023.\nMurphy's 93 career appearances across all competitions is second only to club captain Luciano Acosta since 2022, and as many as fan-favorite Yuya Kubo.\nPerhaps most impressively, Murphy has appeared in all six of the MLS Cup playoff games in FC Cincinnati's growing history, starting five of those matches, too. His first postseason start was in the 2022 Eastern Conference semifinal against Philadelphia Union.\n\u201cI'm really happy to be here,\u201d Murphy said in the news release announcing his extension. \u201cI wanted to stay here, and that was a big thing to me. I really like the city, I love the club and it just means a lot, in my opinion, that FCC have faith in me. That they had the faith in me to draft me and then to give me another contract is a big thing for me. I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity and will keep working hard to prove that faith was worth it.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: FC Cincinnati's Ian Murphy has signed a contract extension",

The sources were granted anonymity as Robinson was yet to officially be announced as a member of the Olympic team.\nRobinson, 27, of Arlington, Massachusetts, is a high-profile addition to the Olympic team as he would serve as one of three over-age players permitted for each national team in what is primarily an Under-23 tournament.\nSteven Goff of The Washington Post first reported Robinson's inclusion on the Olympic team on Saturday.\nThe sources confirmed to The Enquirer that Robinson would likely depart for the Olympic tournament, which is being staged in southern France, after FC Cincinnati's July 13 match against Charlotte FC at TQL Stadium.\nThat means FC Cincinnati would have to account for Robinson's absence for a July 17 home game against Chicago Fire, as well as a July 20 away match against New York Red Bulls. After that, Major League Soccer commences its stoppage in regular-season play to accommodate the Leagues Cup in-season tournament.\nIt appears Robinson will miss six league games for international tournaments this summer after he missed four MLS matches for FC Cincinnati while playing for the U.S. senior men's national team in Copa America.\nAfter the USMNT was eliminated from Copa America on Monday, Robinson returned to FC Cincinnati in the Washington, D.C. region on Tuesday, and played in Wednesday's 3-2 win against D.C. United at Audi Field. He is expected to anchor FCC's back line again on Saturday against Inter Miami CF at TQL Stadium.\nFor the U.S., the Olympic tournament begins July 24 against France. The U.S. will then face New Zealand and Guinea on July 27 and July 30. All three group-stage matches will be staged in Marseille, which is about a five-hour drive from Paris, the host city for the 2024 Olympics.",

        "title": "Miles Robinson: USMNT defender enters Hell is Real with FC Cincinnati | MLSSoccer.com",
        "article": "The Hell is Real derby between the Columbus Crew and FC Cincinnati has shot into prominence as one of MLS\u00e2s most entertainingly intense matchups, fueled by the Ohio clubs\u00e2 rise into the league elite and the colorfully quirky nature of the respective fanbases\u00e2 trash talk over its first seven years of existence.\nIt will undoubtedly remain the case at Lower.com Field on Saturday as the two sides in possession of MLS\u00e2s two biggest trophies tangle again in the showcase fixture of the first matchday of Rivalry Week presented by Continental Tire (7:45 pm ET | Apple TV - Free; FS1/FOX Deportes).\nAll that said, anyone with a passing familiarity with the rabid sporting culture of the Boston area can imagine how Miles Robinson may have experienced even nastier antagonism in the fierce local showdowns of his adolescence in Arlington, Massachusetts.\n\u00e2You got generations of people growing up in the same town, they\u00e2re very prideful in where they're from \u00e2 and they definitely don't like you if you're not from where they\u00e2re from,\u00e2 the FCC defender told MLSsoccer.com last week. \u00e2That type of energy, that passion that you can definitely see when you see all of Boston sports.\u00e2\nThere was no love lost when his Arlington High School teams faced off against their counterparts from places like Belmont, Winchester and Wellesley \u00e2 and in Robinson\u00e2s case, those were actually happening on a court rather than a field, because he played basketball, not soccer, for AHS, due to rules restricting top club players from playing school soccer.\nHe was no slouch, either, despite spending most of the year playing soccer: He won league co-MVP honors and led his team in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals. Brian Ainscough, CEO of the Boston Bolts, Robinson\u00e2s club soccer team, told Boston.com \u00e2we\u00e2re just fortunate enough he wasn\u00e2t a few inches taller. He might have been playing basketball for Syracuse. We\u00e2re lucky we have him as a soccer player.\u00e2\nYouth journey\nUnsurprisingly, his talent made him a target for opposing fans on those cold winter nights at gyms across the region.\n\u00e2Those high-school basketball games when you get individually booed, like, that type of energy is pretty sweet, honestly. I remember getting pretty harassed, almost, in high school basketball,\u00e2 he recalled, the enjoyment of the memories clear in his voice. \u00e2That type of energy definitely brings out the best in me.\u00e2\nRobinson has shown as much throughout his career. In youth soccer, he and his Bolts teammates took a special delight in locking horns with their local professional academy, the New England Revolution. Avert your eyes here, Revs fans: In a parallel universe, the commanding center back might have turned out as a homegrown signing for the club.\n\u00e2They did,\u00e2 said Robinson when asked if the Revs recruited him to join their system. \u00e2And I remember Syracuse kind of wanted me to go there too. And I was like, \u00e2nope.\u00e2\n\u00e2I was always loyal to the Boston Bolts; I always thought they were a great organization, and they always did right by me,\" Robinson said of what's now an MLS NEXT program. \"Honestly, the Revs wasn't even really close to where I was. Boston Bolts were just easier for me to go to, but also, I was always a part of them, and I wouldn't want to leave \u00e2\u00a6 I think I made the right decision. And definitely, all the love goes out to Bolts and Syracuse for helping develop me.\u00e2\nThe journey continued in heated NCAA clashes in Atlantic Coast Conference play, traditionally considered the top competition level in college soccer. Robinson\u00e2s Orange dueled bold-faced names like North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest and Clemson \u00e2 \u00e2Oh yeah, we hated Clemson for sure,\u00e2 he said, perhaps remembering a tense meeting with the Tigers at the 2015 College Cup, Clemson booking a trip to the national championship game via a penalty-kick shootout after a 0-0 deadlock.\nHis upward progress earned him a Generation adidas contract after his sophomore year, Atlanta United snatching him with the second overall SuperDraft pick as they prepared for their MLS expansion debut in 2017.\nUSMNT vs. Mexico\nAs he matured into one of the top defenders on the continent and became a regular member of the US men\u00e2s national team, Robinson showed a knack for big performances in big games. And in Concacaf, they rarely come bigger than USMNT vs. Mexico, particularly when hardware is on the line, as it was when Robinson scored the game-winning goal on a 117th-minute header to cap a man-of-the-match display in the 2021 Gold Cup final, prompting an epic night out in Las Vegas for Gregg Berhalter and his squad.\n\u00e2You need a little rivalry in sports, just to add some pressure and tension in any environment, whether it's like a local game, or town soccer, up to Syracuse, obviously big ACC matchups, and then with Atlanta, Orlando was our big rival. And then with the national team, it\u00e2s obviously Mexico that we play quite often,\u00e2 he said. \u00e2Those games are the ones you want to play in and you want to perform well.\n\u00e2When it's a rivalry game and you feel the passion in the crowd, that type of energy definitely can translate onto the pitch.\u00e2\nRobinson\u00e2s approach to occasions of this magnitude has evolved over the years.\n\u00e2Early in my career, I\u00e2d get really nervous. I think I still get nervous, but it's the type of nerves that propel you into a different level, almost, of focus and attention in the match,\u00e2 he explained. \u00e2Those types of nerves, those butterflies that you can kind of harness in the right way to perform well.\u00e2\nChoosing Cincy\nDeAndre Yedlin saw this as he got to know Robinson on USMNT duty, and is now also his colleague on Cincy\u00e2s back line thanks to a trade from Inter Miami CF earlier this year.\n\u00e2He's one of the most relaxed guys ever. Very, very calm, just an even keel. You don't really hear him yell a lot \u00e2 honestly, you don\u00e2t hear him talk a lot,\u00e2 said Yedlin. \u00e2But he's one of those guys that just speaks with his actions. There's not many center backs that I've played with before this that I felt as comfortable playing with as Miles.\n\u00e2Especially with the way that we want to play, which is pretty high intensity, and where I'm on the front foot a lot and I'm pushing forward pretty high a lot, you need somebody that can cover space. So that's the perfect guy to do it. He's a freak athlete, obviously. Good on the ball, really good in the air \u00e2 there\u00e2s not a lot of flaws to his game.\u00e2\nYedlin\u00e2s words follow closely those of coach Pat Noonan and others around the Orange & Blue who were thrilled when FCC convinced Robinson they were the best next step in his career when he left Atlanta as \u00e2probably the most coveted free agent\u00e2 in MLS last winter, in the words of general manager Chris Albright.\nNote carefully: That\u00e2s \u00e2best next step,\u00e2 not \u00e2next best.\u00e2 Despite being widely expected, for years, to try his hand in Europe at that point, Robinson signed a rare \u00e21 + 1\u00e2 contract with Cincy instead, balancing his earning power and hunger for winning with the desire for future flexibility via a seven-figure wage without a long-term Designated Player deal.\n\u00e2Being a free agent is pretty unique to a lot of MLS players; a lot of players never get that opportunity, especially in MLS. So I think I wanted to take advantage of it,\u00e2 Robinson told MLSsoccer.com during Cincinnati\u00e2s preseason camp in Clearwater, Florida. \u00e2In general, it's very rare to have a short-term deal in MLS and I think that can be very beneficial, especially someone like me, that can be in the national team pool. It's kind of like betting on myself, hoping I can do the best, and I think this is a place where I'm going to be set up for success.\n\u00e2If I'm going to potentially lose money going overseas, I wouldn't really want to do it, in general,\u00e2 he added. \u00e2Based on all the situation, every aspect of the decision, I think it was pretty clear to me that I wanted to come here, whether it be financially, based on my friends and family, my career, all that.\u00e2\nTrusting your gut\nIt provided a fresh setting, a galvanizing change he felt he needed, without gambling on too many variables shifting all at once. That means something when you consider the most traumatic public setback of his career thus far: the ruptured Achilles tendon in Atlanta that crushed his 2022 World Cup dreams, an experience Robinson says \u00e2made me more patient, and recognize how much I love this sport, and I want to continue to be a player for as long as possible.\u00e2\nHe believes European adventures are still out there to be had, just as the 2026 World Cup looms on the horizon, heightening both the opportunities and the perils at his feet. Staying closer to home to hunt further MLS honors in the meantime almost instantly made Robinson a flashpoint among the very online USMNT supporter community, a hefty chunk of which declared he had to cross the Atlantic now, not later.\n\u00e2A lot of people look at players\u00e2 situations and they think soccer is the only thing that they have going on in their life,\u00e2 said Yedlin, who\u00e2s lived both sides of this equation as a richly-hyped young export who spent seven years in the English Premier League and Turkish S\u00c3\u00bcper Lig before returning to MLS in 2022. \u00e2We got families, we've got children, there's certain stuff that could be going on off the field.\n\u00e2So I think a lot of people were surprised the fact that he decided to stay in MLS, or maybe disappointed was the word. But at the end of the day, nobody else is living his life. Nobody else knows what he's going through. And at the end of the day, it's his decision. He's worked to get where he is, he's worked to get the contracts that he's gotten, and it\u00e2s his decision.\u00e2\nBerhalter himself laid out the stakes in clear terms.\n\u00e2The expectations will be that he's a dominant center back in this league, that he performs at a really high level at this league,\u00e2 said the US coach in January. \u00e2And I think he's well aware of that.\u00e2\nHell is Real\nWith FCC hard on the heels of Leo Messi\u00e2s league-leading Inter Miami in this season\u00e2s early going, anchored by his elite backline corps, Robinson feels confident in his choice.\n\u00e2To dominate, your team has to be one of the best in the league and I think we're proving that,\u00e2 he said. \u00e2We have to continue to grow as a team and play well, because I think at the end of the day, if the team looks good then every individual on the team looks just as good. So for me personally, I'm just trying to bring that as a team, hopefully win trophies and then the rest will hopefully fall into place.\n\u00e2We're in pretty good form now, but we\u00e2ve got a lot to build on, and I think everyone still has a few more gears left in them.\u00e2\nIt\u00e2s not only Berhalter who\u00e2s closely watching Robinson\u00e2s level in Cincy. As the most prominent MLS-based USMNTer, his place in the national-team pool will be scrutinized for many reasons, by many observers as this summer\u00e2s US-based Copa Am\u00c3\u00a9rica, the biggest event on the team\u00e2s calendar in the \u00e222 cycle, looms.\nA big result this weekend against a menacing Crew side that just reached the Concacaf Champions Cup final via some of the best MLS performances against Liga MX opposition ever seen? That\u00e2s a decent way to keep yourself in the national conversation.\n\u00e2It's a rivalry that's gained national recognition over the last few seasons, since Cincinnati\u00e2s been an elite team in the league and obviously Columbus had a great season last year,\u00e2 said Robinson. \u00e2You just have two very talented rosters and I think it's definitely going to be a good game between both sides, and great coaches involved.\n\u00e2It's big for the state of Ohio, that's for sure.\u00e2",

        "article": "An FC Cincinnati player will soon be competing on the biggest stage for athletes in the world.\nIn a press release on Monday, FC Cincinnati announced that defender Miles Robinson has been named to the U.S. roster for the Paris 2024 Olympics. According to the release, Robinson is the first player in FC Cincinnati's history to compete at the Olympics.\nRobinson has been named as one of three available overage players on the roster for the Men's U.S. soccer team. Currently, players have to be 23 years old or younger to compete on a U.S. Olympic soccer team. At 27 years old, Robinson is one of only three players on the team over the age requirement.\nRobinson made his Major League Soccer debut in 2018 as a defender for Atlanta United. He proved to be a breakout player for the team, even making club history for the most minutes played by an outfield player in a single season. Robinson has also played on the United States men's national soccer team and has been named as a finalist for MLS defender of the year.\nIn January of 2024, Robinson signed as a free agent with FC Cincinnati on a one-year deal. During his short time with FCC, Robinson has helped create a strong defense for the team, enabling FC Cincinnati to concede the fourth-fewest goals in the league.\nThe U.S. Men's Olympic Soccer Team has not played at the Olympics since 2008. Their first game back at the Olympics will take place on July 24 against host nation France at the Stade de Marseille.\nSubscribe to CityBeat newsletters.\nFollow us: Apple News | Google News | NewsBreak | Reddit | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter | Or sign up for our RSS Feed",

When I was getting started in the industry, I was terrified. Many of my friends were getting their first full time job after college graduation and starting down their career path. I was getting ready to start a six month internship with no promise of a full time job after, and I was afraid of the path in front of me. I worried I was behind, that I wasn't going to make it. That I would fail. I thought about giving up, because that would be easier than facing the unknown ahead of me. But with the support of incredible family and friends, I took the leap and started down my own path. I worked hard, I threw everything I had into being the best I could be and controlled everything I could within my control. I stopped telling myself the story that I was on the wrong path, but instead I assured myself that I was creating my own as I went. And what a cool thing that is to be able to do? Starting down my own path led me to a full time job after the end of six months, and now I've been with the team for six years. I've started down new paths, I've hit so many new milestones and I've learned so much along the way. Every day I remind myself that the path in front of me will always be right, so as long as I keep choosing what makes me happy, keep working as hard as I can, and keep on walking.\"\nOne word to describe you?\nShea Stephenson - Producer\n\"queen\"\nSidnee Berch - Digital Marketing Coordinator\n\"Authentic\"",

He led the league in sacks allowed during the 2022 season and that meant the Bengals weren't in a great position at left tackle for the 2023 season.\nWhat questions are left to answer? Bengals Monday morning briefing\nAs of Monday, there are less than two months until the Hall of Fame Game in Canton, and the only major milestone left this summer is the start of OTAs. After that, players and coaches will disappear for about a month until training camp nears.\nCincinnati Bengals: NFL Network predicts outcome of every game in 2023\nThat schedule has some really easy games on the slate early in the season, sure. But the Bengals go on a post-bye sprint that includes more than half of their AFC North games and some tough encounters with the likes of the 49ers, Bills and Chiefs.\nTed Karras reveals difference between Bengals and Patriots, Bill Belichick\n\u201cBill would talk about 30 to 40 minutes a day. That\u2019s how that program was structured,\u201d Karras said. \u201cI loved listening to Bill. It\u2019s just a different style and we had great camaraderie on those teams, too. This one is different \u2026 It\u2019s less militaristic. The credit for the culture goes to Zac, Duke, Mike (Brown), Katie and Troy (Blackburn). Just being able to pick the right guys. It can\u2019t work if you\u2019ve got guys all over the place. You look from top-to-bottom in this locker room and you\u2019re not going find any (bleeps).\u201d\nElizabeth and Caroline Blackburn are off to a roaring start in Cincinnati as their family works to turn the Bengals into the one of the kings of the NFL jungle.\nBehind the scenes on the business side, two other promising faces were arriving around the same time. In February 2020, Elizabeth Blackburn, the then-27-year-old granddaughter of owner Mike Brown, formally joined the family business as director of strategy and engagement. Fourteen months later, her younger sister Caroline did as well, as senior manager of digital strategy.\nBengals QB Joe Burrow is top 3 in C.J. Stroud\u2019s rankings\nNot that long ago, Stroud said the Cincinnati Bengals passer was one of the best quarterbacks in the world. That\u2019s reflected in new rankings Stroud gave the \u201cCaps Off Podcast\u201d recently.\nAround the league\nBills, LB Leonard Floyd agree to one-year deal\nFloyd is entering his eighth season in the NFL after being selected by the Bears in the first round of the 2016 draft. The pass rusher has logged 47.5 sacks in 104 career starts.\nNorma Hunt, mother of Chiefs chairman and CEO Clark Hunt, dies at 85\nThe matriarch of the Hunt family, Norma was a powerful presence and deeply connected to both the Chiefs and FC Dallas, the Major League Soccer team also owned by the Hunts. She is the only woman to have attended every Super Bowl in league history, including February's game between the Eagles and Chiefs, which saw Kansas City capture its third Super Bowl in franchise history.\nCommanders WR Jahan Dotson on OC Eric Bieniemy: 'He's brought culture to our team'\n\"I feel like he's brought culture to our team,\" Dotson said Saturday at his youth football camp, via Nicki Jhabvala of the Washington Post. \"He's brought a sense of energy, a sense of urgency. It's been really good just being able to learn from him and just get familiar with the things he wants us to do and the things we want to do.\"\nRecently signed Bills LB Shane Ray looking to make NFL comeback after injuries derailed career\nThe Broncos had drafted Ray No. 23 overall in 2015, and in his first season he was a part of Denver's Super Bowl 50 roster. He looked to be building on that momentum in his second year, playing in all 16 games (eight starts) and collecting eight sacks. But in 2017 came the emergence of recurring wrist injuries that severely limited his playing time over the next two years.\nFive assistant coach hires that'll have biggest impact on '23 NFL season: Nathaniel Hackett's redemption?\nThe NFL is filled with so many star players and prominent head coaches that it's easy to overlook how much impact assistants can have on championship aspirations. The right hire at the right time can unlock the true potential of a team that just can't get over the hump. It can lead to more effective quarterback play, more disruptive defense and more excitement about all things possible. The men who usually thrive in those roles understand the pressure that comes with the job and can't wait to show how they'll respond.",

        "title": "Meet The Billionaire Family Behind The Cincinnati Bengals, The NFL\u2019s Second-Least-Valuable\u00a0Team",
        "article": "Legendary coach Paul Brown brought the NFL to Cincinnati more than half a century ago. His son Mike, granddaughter Katie, and the rest of the family are still trying to win the big game.\nTo understand the contrast between the two teams chasing football immortality on Sunday, the Los Angeles Rams and the Cincinnati Bengals, look no further than their owners.\nThe Rams are the glitzy $4.8 billion crown jewel of billionaire Stan Kroenke\u2019s $10.5 billion sports empire, set to play on Sunday in the palatial SoFi Stadium he built for his team. Kroenke\u2014whose wife, Ann Walton, is an heir to the Walmart fortune\u2014also owns the Denver Nuggets and Arsenal FC and is seen as one of the most powerful people in sports. Meanwhile, the Bengals\u2014the NFL\u2019s second-least-valuable franchise, at an estimated $2.3 billion\u2014are a family business, cofounded by coaching legend Paul Brown half a century ago and tightly controlled by his 86-year-old son Mike, who is a relative unknown outside of football.\nIt\u2019s a modern-day matchup of David and Goliath.\n\u201cThe Brown family, as long as I\u2019ve been around the league, has never been focused on making the most money,\u201d says Marc Ganis, president of the consulting firm Sportscorp, who has worked with numerous NFL teams and owners. \u201cThey\u2019ve been focused on operating in a professional, solid manner and trying to put a good product on the field.\u201d\nEven that standard has proved challenging for a franchise that has been mired in mediocrity for most of its 54-season history, reaching the postseason just 15 times and losing in its two previous Super Bowl appearances, in 1982 and 1989. The last time the Bengals won a playoff game was 1991, which has led to plenty of disgruntled fans lashing out at Brown over the years. Yet the NFL\u2019s soaring popularity has pushed up revenues for all of its teams and minted the Brown family a fortune\u2014Forbes values their stake in the team at $2.1 billion.\nWin or lose, football has always been the family\u2019s focus. Patriarch Paul Brown helped bring the team to Cincinnati in 1967. Mike, his middle son, who played quarterback at Dartmouth and graduated from Harvard Law School, worked alongside him from the outset. Mike\u2019s brothers, Robin and Peter, were also involved with the team until their deaths in 1978 and 2017, respectively. Over time, other family members joined. Mike\u2019s daughter Katie Blackburn is executive vice president of the team and the first woman to be named to the NFL\u2019s Competition Committee. Son Paul H. Brown, son-in-law Troy Blackburn and even Mike\u2019s granddaughters, Elizabeth and Caroline Blackburn, work for the Bengals as well. (The Browns declined to participate in this story.)\nThe family\u2019s football roots date back even earlier. Paul Brown was a legendary coach and a pioneer in the NFL\u2019s early years. The Ohio native, who played football at Miami University, went 96-9-3 as a high school coach, won the national championship as the head coach of Ohio State in 1941 and ran the Cleveland Browns as general manager and head coach for 16 years. The literal namesake of that franchise, Brown led the team to three NFL championships in the 1950s. Then Cleveland owner Art Modell fired him in 1963.\nTHE RICH AND THE RICHER\nThe Brown family\u2019s football team is worth billions of dollars, but Stan Kroenke\u2019s sports empire blows them away.\nAfter a brief retirement, Brown sought a return to professional football. This time, he had no interest in working for someone else and decided the best way to keep control was to start a team himself. With the help of his son Mike, Brown homed in on Cincinnati. Backed by a group of 11 local investors that included Brown, in 1967 the city won the tenth franchise of the American Football League, which had already agreed to merge with the NFL in 1970. Brown and his partners paid an estimated $7.5 million expansion fee. He got only a 10% stake, according to court documents, but controlled the club as head coach, general manager and voting trustee.\nThe Bengals got off to a strong start, reaching the postseason three times from 1970 to 1975. Brown relinquished his coaching duties in 1975 but remained general manager until his death in 1991. In that span, the Bengals reached the Super Bowl in 1982 and again in 1989 but were beaten both times by Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers.\nMeanwhile, changes were sweeping through the owner\u2019s box. Brown, who had increased his stake to 20%, agreed to sell nearly all of his shares to Bengals cofounder and president John Sawyer in 1983. There was a catch, though: The Brown family could buy back almost all of Sawyer\u2019s stake as early as 1993 for $25,000 per share, a fraction of its value at the time. When the date arrived, Mike and the family did just that, paying Sawyer a net price of $1.6 million. (The IRS later contested the transaction, arguing the deal was part of Paul Brown\u2019s estate and $30 million in taxes plus interest were owed. But the courts ruled in favor of the Browns.)\nUnder Mike Brown, who became the team\u2019s de facto general manager when he assumed control (the only other owner with a similar arrangement is Cowboys\u2019 Jerry Jones), the team\u2019s performance on the field has been dismal. From 1991 to 2004, the Bengals posted an abysmal 71-153 record, failing to qualify for the playoffs even once. In 2005, Cincinnati won 11 games and returned to the postseason, only to have star quarterback Carson Palmer shred his knee on the first play of the first playoff game. They lost. Loyal to a fault, Brown stood by then-coach Marvin Lewis for a total of 16 seasons\u2014only seven were winning ones.\n\u201cHe took too much on himself and was not very good at it,\u201d longtime Cincinnati Enquirer columnist Paul Daugherty told Cincinnati Magazine in 2014. \u201c[The Bengals] were not only the worst team in the NFL, they were arguably the worst team in professional sports. And it was entirely Mike\u2019s show.\u201d\nTHE GREAT DIVIDE\nWhile both competitors in Super Bowl LVI ranked in the bottom half of Forbes\u2019 NFL team valuations during the early 2010s, the Rams soared toward the top after moving to Los Angeles.\nBrown found other ways to be successful, though. He delivered the Bengals a new venue in 2000, Paul Brown Stadium, four years after the city passed a half-cent sales tax increase that funded new stadiums for both Major League Baseball\u2019s Reds and his club. Taxpayers picked up most of the $455 million bill and millions in future maintenance costs. The family profited, collecting more than $50 million in salaries and dividends from 1994 to 2000, while at the same time paying coaches, trainers and scouts less than most other teams, according to a 2011 Cincinnati Magazine article. Brown also, in a series of transactions, raised the family\u2019s stake to 97%. In 2002, court records show, he paid around $6 million (the Bengals were valued at $507 million at the time) for 10% owned by Austin Knowlton, who died in 2003. Brown bought out the other 30% held by Knowlton\u2019s estate in 2011 for $200 million.\nAround the NFL, Brown has been criticized for his reluctance to maximize the Bengals\u2019 revenue streams, marching to the beat of his own drum. The team, for instance, has never sold the naming rights to Paul Brown Stadium. \u201cHe is not afraid or intimidated to be the only negative vote in the ownership room,\u201d Ganis says. Brown was notoriously the only one to vote against expanded replay review in 2019. \u201cThat takes a certain amount of courage, frankly, and commitment to your convictions to do something like that.\u201d\nNow he finally has the chance to collect the prize that has eluded his family and city for decades. But no matter what happens on Sunday, don\u2019t expect too much from Brown. In the immortal words of his father, \u201cWhen you lose, say nothing. When you win, say even less.\u201d",

This season, fans will notice new banners, graphics and murals installed throughout the stadium.\n\"We know when fans come to games, they want to come, they want to get high-quality food, they want to get it quickly and get back to their seats so they can watch the game,\" said Caroline Blackburn, the Bengals' senior manager of digital strategy. \"That\u2019s what all of our concessions renovations are about.\"\nThe renovations will cost $20 million and will be fully funded by the Bengals.\nThe Bengals added 78 new self-serve kiosks and 14 \"grab-and-go\" stands throughout the stadium in order to reduce lines at concessions.\nIn addition to traditional game day favorites, fans can now enjoy Skyline coneys. Chicken lovers will also find two additional Tender, Love and Chicken locations.

Blackburn said in the interim, they wanted to do what they could to positively impact the fan experience.\n\"They\u2019re certainly not the whole picture, but they're pieces of the puzzle that we wanted to improve,\" said Blackburn. \"Still obviously being hopeful that there will be a larger scale renovation at some point.\"\nWatch Live:",

So what did he do instead of practicing his typical position?\nHe worked on punting.\nAccording to Enquirer reporter Charlie Goldsmith, Burrow opened practice Friday by working on punts with special teams coordinator Darrin Simmons.\n\"He\u2019s pretty good at it,\" Goldsmith wrote on X/Twitter.\nThe Bengals posted a video of Burrow's kick to social media.\nIt's hard to imagine Burrow taking punter Brad Robbins' spot, whom the Bengals selected in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL draft. But perhaps he may need to break out the pooch punt on an opposing defense this season.\nThe decision for Burrow not to throw Friday was planned.\n\"We're going to play it by ear,\" Burrow said at his Wednesday press conference. \"We don't really plan on practicing more than two days in a row beyond this first chunk. We're going to play that third day by ear for the next week and then after that I plan on going every day.\"\nThe Bengals open preseason play at home Aug. 10 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",

        "title": "Diane from 'Big Brother 5' opens up about her season 20 years later",
        "article": "In 2004, 2 Cincinnati students were 'Big Brother' stars. How one remembers the wild season\nTwenty years ago, Diane McFarland, n\u00e9e Henry, sat in a computer lab at Northern Kentucky University when she received an email from a TV show producer who had seen her photo on a modeling website.\n\"He said, 'I'm casting for a game show, any chance you'd be interested? Can't tell you what it is yet,'\" McFarland, who was raised in Hillsboro, Ohio, recalled to The Enquirer. \"I didn't really believe it at first.\"\nLittle did McFarland know, the show would go on to become one of the most successful reality shows in network television history: \"Big Brother.\"\nThe rest happened quickly. Producers ultimately added her to the season 5 cast, and McFarland went into sequester in the days leading up to the show airing. While cut off from the world, she watched the previous seasons to prepare as best she could.\n\"I can't say that I went in there with a whole lot of strategy, other than just to hopefully be friends with most of the people,\" she said.\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\nConnecting with someone from home\nMaking friends helped McFarland immediately.\n\"Big Brother\" is a game that's always changing. Players have to stay fluid in the house, and they need to be able to adapt when needed. That is, if they want to be successful.\n\"Tough to adjust, especially when you just can't go anywhere,\" she said. \"You can't get away from these people arguing and stuff like that. When you're face to face with people, oh my gosh, you just have to do it right then and there. That was tough, but like I said, the more friendships you had in the house, the easier it was to adjust to the whole thing.\"\n\"I hate to say that I (attribute) some of that adjustment to Drew (Daniel), but I do.\"\nMcFarland formed what may have been her strongest connection to Drew Daniel, another player with Greater Cincinnati ties. Daniel is from Urbana but attended Miami University. She says they were \"inseparable\" from the jump, after learning they both had twin siblings and were from Ohio.\nBut they became a little more than just alliance members in the house.\n\"Having a little showmance really passed the time real well,\" McFarland said.\nStaying close to each other was for survival. They had to navigate through a cast filled with big personalities, and a season with arguably the most outrageous twist ever.\nRemembering the Project DNA twist\n\"Big Brother 5\" notoriously had its Project DNA twist, which involved two sets of siblings.\nSimilar to McFarland and Daniel, houseguest Adria Klein also had a twin. But she and her sister, Natalie Carroll, were allowed to swap into the game without their fellow cast members knowing. With no one catching them, Carroll eventually entered the game as herself, playing alongside her sister.\n\"While going through the casting process, I now look back and know for a fact that that's what they were casting Drew and I for probably as well because our twins had come out at the same time to run through some of the process,\" McFarland said.\n\"You don't think about that kind of stuff. I would've never went into the house and been like, 'Hm, I wonder if there is a twin in here.' And then when the other one showed up, I was just flabbergasted.\"\nBut that wasn't the biggest headline to come out of Project DNA.\n\"Big Brother\" also had a brother-sister pair who didn't know they were siblings. Michael \"Cowboy\" Ellis and Nakomis Dedmon met each other and learned they were related while inside the house.\n\"I think I was too young at the time to really process that,\" McFarland said. \"As fast as they told everybody, it's almost like, that was it. The two of them didn't really even care that much.\"\nTwo Ohioans in the final three\nThrough all the challenges, Daniel and McFarland persevered, making it to the final three.\nYet she still has a major regret.\n\"Getting my head stuck in the love gutter,\" she said. \"I don't even think I was playing to my full potential. I was just so enamored with him.\"\nDaniel won the final Head of Household competition of season 5, beating out McFarland and Ellis. As winner, he had to evict one of the two, to which he chose to send McFarland out of the house and go to the final two with Ellis.\nDaniel ultimately won the season, beating Ellis 4-3 in the jury vote.\nThe Enquirer attempted to reach out to Daniel but could not find his best form of contact.\nReturning for 'Big Brother All-Stars'\nMcFarland's \"Big Brother\" journey didn't end there. She returned two seasons later for \"Big Brother All-Stars,\" when she went against some of the best players from the first six seasons, including Dedmon and Jase Wirey from her season.\n\"That was kind of terrible,\" she said. \"I was very, very excited about it. At the time, we assumed that that probably would've been one of the last seasons. That was the rumor. ... But me personally, I just wasn't in a good spot for it.\"\nAccording to McFarland, pregaming led to her demise. Despite being advised not to, she says most of her fellow all-stars connected with each other prior to the show so they could map their journeys to the end.\n\"Every single person in that house called every other person in that house,\" she said. \"Everybody pregamed. And believe it or not, season 5 was the only ones who really didn't pregame.\"\nThree of the first four houseguests evicted were from season 5. McFarland was the fourth evicted and finished 11th overall.\n\"We were sitting ducks basically because everybody in there had alliances except for us,\" she said.\nMike \"Boogie\" Malin from season 2 later beat out Erika Landin from season 4 by a jury vote of 6-1 in the finale, winning the \"All-Stars\" crown.\nWhere Diane from 'Big Brother 5' is today\nAfter 20 years (and 18 since \"Big Brother All-Stars\"), how does McFarland feel about her time on the CBS show?\n\"It's a little easier for me now to watch it and not be as embarrassed,\" she said. \"It's so embarrassing. It's a very strange experience to get to see yourself on TV when you go back and watch it. But I was glad that I did. The biggest thing I took away from 'Big Brother' was self reflection. You got to see all the aspects of yourself that maybe you didn't like, and you got to change them and grow and become a better person.\"\nMcFarland, who still watches the show and was admittedly a big fan of Taylor Hale from season 24, says she keeps in touch with many of her fellow castmates. She talks to Marvin Latimer and Mike Lubinski. Even Scott Long, whom she helped evict during her season 5 Head of Household reign, is a close friend, she says.\n\"Nakomis and I were so close for so long, but she went to Texas and I went back to Ohio (from California) and that was kind of the end of that,\" McFarland said. \"(From) 'All Stars,' Marcellas (Reynolds), Dr. Will (Kirby), Boogie will send me a random text from time to time. ... All of us kind of still mingle on Facebook and stuff when and if we can.\"\nMcFarland lived in California after the show, and she says she last spoke to Daniel when they briefly met up there around 2008.\n\"I have never talked to the kid since, in fact I don't know anybody who has,\" she says.\nAccording to LinkedIn, Daniel now practices law in Columbus. He also appears to have a blog in which he shares brief thoughts on \"Big Brother\" from time to time.\nMcFarland moved back to Ohio in 2010. She now lives in West Union with her husband, Shawn, and two kids, Rose and Chase. The latter even rose to internet fame of sorts in recent years, dressing up as Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow for Halloween.\nChase is autistic, and McFarland found he enjoyed staying in \"regular clothes\" for the holiday. So in 2022, she created a version of the floral suit Burrow wore prior to a game against the Miami Dolphins, so that Chase could sport it as his costume. And in 2023, her son wore a multi-colored sweatshirt similar to what the quarterback wore before a game against the Arizona Cardinals last season.\n\"Everybody is kind of to the point to where we know what autism is about, but if you go up and ask anybody on the street, 'Tell me about autism, what do you know about it?' A lot of people, they don't even know where to start,\" she said of creating more awareness.\nA 2022 video of Chase that McFarland's sister-in-law posted racked up over 30,000 views on TikTok. Last year, his costume had nearly 500 likes on Instagram.\n\"I just wish Joe Burrow would wear better outfits earlier in the season because he always will bust out the best one a week or two before Halloween, and I am like sewing for days,\" McFarland joked.\n\"Big Brother\" returns for a 26th season 9 p.m. Wednesday.",

        "title": "Why Kings Island isn't just an amusement park. It gave me my family",
        "article": "Kings Island is more than an amusement park. It's the reason I have my family\nFew places give adults the same magic feeling they felt when they were kids.\nFor me, Kings Island takes me back to 10-year-old David. The distant sound of cheers. The smell of funnel cakes. The rush I feel when riding Diamondback or The Beast.\nBut the 52-year-old amusement park is more than an adrenaline destination for me.\nIt's part of my family's story.\nMy favorite childhood park\nI first visited Kings Island when I was about 4 years old. It instantly became one of my favorite places in the world. I made my grandfather ride The Racer with me four times, twice frontward and twice backward. That was when they actually had the backward facing coaster.\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\nMy family and I then made the park a regular hangout spot during the summer. We'd spend weekends there. I'd go there with classmates. Friends would take me with their families or vice versa.\nIt was the anticipation I felt pre-Drop Zone (I refuse to call it Drop Tower). Or the competitive juices that flowed when my friends and I competed in the 3-point shootout. We always wanted to win a jersey but never could.\nThose were among the experiences that brought me back.\nIt also made tough days better.\nI was on a Kings Island trip during LeBron James' infamous \"Decision\" special in 2010. As a big Cleveland Cavaliers fan, I failed in my search for a TV. So I snuck into a bathroom and called my friend, who then put his phone next to his TV's speaker (this was pre-FaceTime).\n\"I'm going to take my talents to South Beach and join the Miami Heat,\" I heard James say, as I huddled in a corner next to a trash can.\nI hung up the phone, crushed. But I at least eased the pain with some blue ice cream.\nThe trip that changed everything\nOne trip during my freshman year of high school changed my life forever.\nMy buddies and I went to Kings Island on a Saturday in May. I had a youth group event at my church the day before and learned one of my church friends was also going with her school the same day.\nHer name was Macey. We had been friends for a while but never actually spent time together outside of our friend group at church.\nShe didn't even hang out with her classmates that day, choosing to ride rides with me and my friends instead.\nAnd we had ourselves a time, screaming on Delirium. Eating snacks. She playfully picked on me while on The Beast.\nOur friendship started feeling ... different.\nMy friends said they could tell we liked each other, which hadn't crossed my mind before. I previously \"talked\" to her best friend (you know, the term us millennials used for pre-dating). She did the same with my cousin.\nBut we started texting more after that trip. We had more inside jokes, and spent more time with each other over our friends.\nWeeks later, we were dating.\nKings Island's special place in my heart\nMay 14, 2024, will mark 13 years since that trip. May 27 will be the 13th anniversary of when Mace became my girlfriend and our eighth wedding anniversary.\nAfter that day in 2011, we continued visiting Kings Island, reliving that fateful day our lives changed.\nMy mom used to get us season passes for Christmas every year. When we moved to Cincinnati in 2014, we would just go on random week nights. Or when we just need something to do. One year, we got a season-long meal plan, and I'd just go to the park to grab lunch (I was a broke college kid).\nIt was our home away from home.\nI haven't been back since 2019. COVID-19 messed things up for a couple years, then my wife couldn't go on rides when she was pregnant in 2022 and 2023. We welcomed our first two children those years.\nBut I still often reflect on those memories.\nOn the childhood trips with friends. On the random concerts I attended at the park's Timberwolf Amphitheatre. On going there for senior skip day in high school or eating lunch in the Festhaus. Or of all the dips into the wave pool at Soak City.\nSo whether you're 4 years old going for your first time, or you're taking your kids to your favorite childhood park, I hope you too make magical memories this amusement park season.",

        "title": "Decreased velocity could be sign of something more troubling for this Reds pitcher",
        "article": "Decreased velocity could be sign of something more troubling for this Reds pitcher\nWhat's wrong with Buck Farmer?\nBuck Farmer was one of the Cincinnati Reds most reliable relief pitchers in 2023. Farmer made 71 appearances out of the Reds bullpen last season and helped keep the team afloat down the stretch. Farmer went 4-5 with a 4.20 ERA, punched out 70 batters, and recorded three saves.\nThe Reds decided to bring back Farmer this offseason, signing the right-hander to a one-year, $2.25 million deal. Farmer pitched well this spring, racking up 12 strikeouts and walking just one batter through nine games during Cactus League play.\nBut Farmer's start to season has been troubling. Monday's performance against the Seattle Mariners was a reflection of just how poorly the veteran has performed this season. But Farmer's early-season struggles have been highlighted by a dip in velocity.\nDecreased velocity could send Reds RHP Buck Farmer to the IL\nLast season, according to Baseball Savant, Farmer's four-seam fastball averaged 93.9 mph. He went to the heater 43% of the time. During his first seven appearances out of the Reds bullpen this season, Farmer's four-seamer is sitting at 91.2 mph, and he's turning to his fastball just 15% of the time. That's a drop of almost three miles per hour. Combine that with his usage-rate, and there could be more going on that Reds fans are unaware of.\nWith the rash of pitcher injuries popping up throughout Major League Baseball this season, Reds fans are hoping that Farmer's name isn't added to that list. Spencer Strider (Atlanta Braves), Shane Bieber (Cleveland Guardians), and the Reds own Tejay Antone have all been ruled out for the season following elbow injuries.\nThe Reds have reinforcements working their way back to the big leagues. Ian Gibaut, who was suffering from a forearm injury throughout spring training, could be back on the mound when the Reds return from their road trip on Friday. Sam Moll, who was slowed by a shoulder injury, is on a rehab assignment as well.\nLook for one or both of those pitchers to return to the Reds roster later this month. If Farmer's struggles can be attributed to an injury, fans could see the 33-year-old to wind up on the 15-day IL. If not, the Reds may be forced to designate Farmer for assignment. Based on his performance this season, if Cincinnati DFA's Farmer, chances are good that he could accept an outright assignment to Triple-A Louisville and remain in the organization.",

The veteran has experience as a starter and reliever, and now that he didn't have to pitch on Thursday, perhaps Bell could piggyback Martinez behind Lodolo on Saturday to help ease the lefty back into the rotation.\nMartinez hasn't been exceptional during his first two starts of the season, but he hasn't been abysmal either. Martinez owns a 7.20 ERA through his first two starts with the Reds. The 33-year-old has nine punch outs through 10 innings of work, but has allowed an abundance of hits (14) so far this season.\nOn Saturday, Reds fans can expect the team to option Carson Spiers back to Triple-A Louisville and activate Lodolo from the IL. It'll mark the southpaw's first major league start since early-May of last season. The Reds can then move Martinez into the role that Spiers filled earlier this week when he logged four innings and helped give the bullpen a break.\nGiving Martinez deeper stints in games than the other relievers will keep him sharp in the event the Reds need someone to make a spot start, while also providing extra rest for the other seven relievers on the team's roster. Look for Lodolo to start on Saturday, Martinez to move to the bullpen, and Spiers to head back to the Derby City.",

        "article": "3 outfielders the Reds can still bring on board during TJ Friedl\u00e2s injury rehab\nTJ Friedl will miss the first several weeks of the 2024 season.\nCincinnati Reds outfielder TJ Friedl won't be on the field for Opening Day. The 28-year-old was arguably Cincinnati's best player in 2023 and the table-setter for manager David Bell's lineup. Friedl suffered a wrist injury during spring training and will be out of action for approximately six weeks.\nFor the moment, the plan is to ride with a combination of Will Benson and Stuart Fairchild in center field. But as the 2024 season is about to begin, the Reds are still short one player.\nCincinnati can always recall Bubba Thompson to take that spot, but there could be some alternatives available. Might the Reds dip back into free agency? Is there a trade candidate that Reds President of Baseball Operations has his eye on? Could the Reds call up one of their young prospects? Who could replace Friedl while the Reds outfielder begins to rehab from his injury?\nKyle Lewis, free agent outfielder\nIt's somewhat surprising that Kyle Lewis is still without a team. The former AL Rookie of the Year began his career with a bang, hitting a home run in each of his first three games. Lewis' performance during the pandemic shortened 2020 season earned him recognition from all over, and the former first-round pick was expected to shine in the Seattle Mariners outfield for the next decade.\nBut a knee injury in 2021 torpedoed Lewis' career. The outfielder tore the meniscus in his right knee and subsequently missed most of his sophomore season. Lewis battled a concussion in 2022 and lingering effects from his knee injury saw Lewis play in just 36 games.\nThe 2022 season was his last in the Emerald City. Lewis latched on with the Arizona Diamondbacks for a short stint last year, but was non-tendered after the 2023 season concluded. Lewis never signed this past offseason.\nLewis could be a sneaky add to the Reds roster, but having not played this spring, it seems like gamble to bring the 28-year-old this close to the season. Lewis does have minor league options remaining, so the Reds could conceivably sign him to a contract and send him to Triple-A for a tuneup. There are very few players on the open market with Lewis' skillset, but health is always a concern. Lewis has played in just 34 major league games the past two seasons.\n\u00c3scar Mercado, Padres outfielder\nReds fans are familiar with \u00c3scar Mercado. The outfielder began his major league career with the Reds' NL Central Division rival, the St. Louis Cardinals. After being traded to the Guardians for former Reds outfielder Conner Capel, Mercado spent the next few years in Cleveland.\nMercado was expected to be one of the better young prospects in the Cleveland outfield, but instead, the highly-regarded outfield prospect crashed and burned. Mercado had a tremendous season in 2019, but it was all downhill from there. After hitting .269/.318/.443 during his first year in the bigs, Mercado bottomed out with a meager .348 OPS during the 2020 season.\nMercado bounced around with the Philadelphia Phillies, San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, as well as second stint with both the Guardians and Cardinals. Mercado isn't so much a journeyman but rather a failed prospect.\nBut after signing a minor-league deal with the Padres this past offseason, Mercado put together a nice spring campaign and almost broke camp with the Friars prior to the Seoul Series last week. Mercado hit .320/.433/.640 this spring with two home runs and seven RBI.\nMercado was outrighted to Triple-A El Paso in favor of San Diego's young prospect Jackson Merrill. The 29-year-old could likely be had in a trade for next to nothing and could provide a nice short-term fix for Friedl's absence to start the 2024 season.\nBlake Dunn, Reds outfield prospect\nIf the Reds were in search of an internal candidate, Bubba Thompson would likely be the guy. Thompson bounced around to a couple different teams this offseason, but somehow returned to the Reds prior to the start of spring camp. Thompson hit .269/.367/.462 during Cactus League play.\nBut the Reds have one of their top prospects on the cusp of making his major league debut. Blake Dunn was invited to spring training this year, and while he battled an elbow injury early in camp, Dunn excelled when he finally got on the field. According to FanGraphs, Dunn hit .571/.667/.714 with a wRC+ of 275.\nDunn has arguably done everything he needs to do in order to make it to The Show. Dunn was the Reds best minor league player in 2023, and at 25 years old, it's doubtful he needs much more seasoning.\nHowever, Dunn's contract would need to be selected in order to make his major league debut. At this stage of the season, it seems more likely that the Reds would run with Thompson, or even Jacob Hurtubise, both of whom are on the Reds 40-man roster.\nBut don't rule Dunn out completely. Even if he doesn't make the Reds Opening Day roster, a strong showing during the first couple weeks down at Triple-A Louisville could earn the former Western Michigan standout a call-up to the big leagues.",

        "title": "Regressing Reds prospects limit Nick Krall's marketable assets at MLB trade deadline",
        "article": "Regressing Reds prospects limit Nick Krall's marketable assets at MLB trade deadline\nThe Reds could be buyers at the trade deadline, but what will they be selling?\nThanks to a sharp turnaround over the last three weeks, the Cincinnati Reds once again find themselves in the thick of the NL Wild Card hunt. They'll enter this weekend's matchup with the Milwaukee Brewers in the conversation with about nine other teams currently bidding for one of the NL's postseason slots.\nThe Reds will have infielder Noelvi Marte returning from his PED suspension later this month and with any luck, corner infielder Christian Encarnacion-Strand will be back around the same time. If the two of them hit the ground running it'll be a major boost for the offense.\nHowever, the Reds' roster does have some weak spots even with Marte and Encarnacion-Strand returning. It seems likely that president of baseball operations Nick Krall will work to address them at the MLB trade deadline later this summer; potentially adding an impact bat or a mid-rotation type arm.\nReds prospects Connor Phillips & Chase Petty have struggled in 2024\nUnfortunately for Krall, two of his prime assets are going in the wrong direction down in the minors. Coming into the season, MLB Pipeline had right-handed pitchers Connor Phillips and Chase Petty ranked as the Reds' fifth and sixth-best prospects, respectively.\nPhillips debuted with the Reds in 2023 but stumbled to a 6.97 ERA in five starts. That poor performance has carried over into 2024 where the 23-year-old has seen his strikeout rate plummet, his walk rate skyrocket, and his ERA suffer accordingly.\nHeading into Friday's start for the Louisville Bats, Phillips owned a 9.00 ERA with an equally discouraging 7.90 FIP. In 50 innings, he's posted an astounding 46 walks. That level of performance just isn't going to play.\nYou almost have to wonder if Phillips is pitching through an injury with that lack of control because an almost 18% walk rate is untenable and could be a ticket out of the Louisville rotation.\nReds prospects Connor Phillips & Chase Petty have an all-time low trade value\nPetty has been better than Phillips, but nowhere near the level of production that we saw at lower levels in 2023. He's striking out just over 20% of batters at Double-A Chattanooga, which would be the lowest rate in a full season of his young career. Petty has also seen an uptick in his walk rate, though it sits at a manageable 8.1%.\nPetty still has time to turn this year around but after watching him post a 1.95 ERA in 60 innings at High-A Dayton last year, expectations for him were through the roof. One has to hope that his worse-than-average .358 BABIP and the shockingly unlucky 58.4% strand rate will see some positive regression in the near future.\nPetty's 4.00 FIP suggests that he's getting the short end of the stick but you'd still like to see the performance reflect the inputs. Right now, that's not the case.\nUltimately, if Krall wants to make any significant trades, he might have to do so without including either Petty or Phillips. The backsliding we've seen from both of them is discouraging in its own right, but doubly so considering their performance is killing their trade value at a moment where the Reds might need to make a deal to improve the major league roster.",

        "title": "TJ Friedl's injury timeline thrusts this ill-suited Reds player into everyday role",
        "article": "TJ Friedl's injury timeline thrusts this ill-suited Reds player into everyday role\nReds fans may not see TJ Friedl until after the All-Star break.\nThe Cincinnati Reds will be without TJ Friedl for the next two to three weeks, at least. The Reds outfielder was declared out with a hamstring injury and Cincinnati placed Friedl on the 10-day IL. In a corresponding move, the Reds selected the contract of Levi Jordan from Triple-A Louisville.\nThis is the latest setback in what' sure to be a forgettable season for Friedl. The 29-year-old began the year on the IL with a fractured wrist, then after returning for just six games, was plunked on the hand and missed another couple of weeks with a broken thumb. Friedl's latest injury comes on the heels of a stupendous play that saw him make a diving catch last week at PNC Park.\nFriedl had some lingering effects, but was back in the lineup late last week. The outfielder was reportedly playing at less than 100%, and the team made the decision to shut him down for the next few weeks.\nTJ Friedl's injury timeline thrusts Reds OF Stuart Fairchild into everyday role\nThis latest injury will require Stuart Fairchild to act as the Reds' everyday centerfielder \u00e2 a role that doesn't necessarily fit his skillset. Fairchild is oftentimes used as a platoon bat against left-handed pitching, but has struggled against right-handers this season.\nA quick look at Fairchild's splits shows exactly why Reds manager David Bell keeps the outfielder out of the starting lineup when the team faces a right-handed starter. Fairchild has hit .289/.362/.422 against southpaws this season, but boasts a paltry .104/.189/.376 slash line against right-handed pitching.\nThe Reds could chose to deploy Will Benson in center field against right-handers, but the 26-year-old has looked awful at the dish this season. Though Benson's splits are vastly better against right-handers than lefties, a .215/.293/.419 slash line is hardly worthy of inclusion in the starting lineup.\nBlake Dunn is currently on the seven-day IL at Triple-A and not an option at the moment. Minor leaguer Peyton Burdick has a handful of games played in center field during his major league career, but his stats at Triple-A hardly warrant a call-up.\nSorry, Reds fans, but look for Fairchild to get the lion's share of reps in center field while Friedl is on the IL. It's far from ideal, but that seems to be the way this season has gone thus far. At least Fairchild plays above-average defense. The former second-round pick has made some phenomenal catches this season and is worth 3 outs above average according to Baseball Savant.",

        "article": "Tejay Antone calling clutch moment shows he should be permanent fixture in Reds\u00e2 TV booth\nGet this man a headset!\nIt's time for Tejay Antone to become a permanent part of the Bally Sports broadcast crew. Earlier this season, Antone correctly predicted that Cincinnati Reds reliever Fernando Cruz would throw an unhittable pitch to Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Trea Turner. Cruz's two-strike split-finger fastball was swung on and missed by the Phillies' All-Star.\nAntone did one better on Thursday afternoon at Great American Ball Park. While rehabbing from surgery, Antone made another trip to the Reds broadcast booth to join John Sadak and Barry Larkin. What unfolded in the sixth inning was unreal.\nLatest prognostication proves Tejay Antone should be permanent fixture in Reds' TV booth\nWith Spencer Steer leading off in the bottom of the sixth inning and the Reds trailing the San Diego Padres 4-2, Antone began talking about the homer-friendly confines of GABP. The Reds reliever said, \"Hopefully this inning we can get a runner on and then tie it up.\"\nUpon saying that, Padres reliever Enyel De Los Santos delivered a 3-2 pitch that missed the strike zone and allowed Steer to walk down to first base. The next batter was the recently recalled Nick Martini.\nMartini took the first pitch right down the middle for a strike, but uncorked on the 0-1 offering from De Los Santos and sent it over the wall in right field to tie the game. It was Martini's first round-tripper since returning from his tuneup down in the minor leagues.\nAfter the ball landed in the right field bleachers, Antone said, \"Called it.\" That he did. Hilariously, Sadak bid farewell to Antone the inning prior, assuming his time in the broadcast booth was up. But Antone wanted to stick around for one more inning. After this latest prediction, Antone needs to have a front row seat in the press box for every single Reds game until the end of the 2024 season.",

        "article": "TJ Friedl's injury may force this Reds prospect onto the Opening Day roster\nTJ Friedl exited Saturday's spring game with a sprained wrist.\nThe most irreplaceable player on the Cincinnati Reds roster went down on Saturday night. During a Cactus League game against the Seattle Mariners, TJ Friedl made a diving attempt at a fly ball and landed awkwardly.\nFriedl needed to be helped off the field by the Reds training staff and was later diagnosed with a sprained right wrist. According to MLB.com, Friedl will receive a precautionary MRI to be sure that there's no extensive damage.\nIf there is one position on Cincinnati's roster that is incredibly thin, it's center field. While X-rays were negative, one has to assume that Friedl's status for Opening Day is in doubt. If Friedl begins the 2024 season on the injured list, look for Jacob Hurtubise to make his major league debut.\nTJ Friedl's injury may force Reds prospect Jacob Hurtubise onto the Opening Day roster\nThe Reds have other options. Will Benson has played center field in the past and could start in place of Friedl. Stuart Fairchild, who's been tremendous throughout spring training, could also man the position in Friedl's absence. But Hurtubise would be the most logical replacement if Friedl was sidelined to start the season.\nHurtubise and Friedl have a similar style of play. Neither is too proud to lay down a bunt, speed is an essential part of their arsenal, and both Hurtubise and Friedl play above-average defense in center field. While he wouldn't necessarily start, having Hurtubise on the roster gives Reds manager David Bell a versatile bench piece heading into the 2024 season.\nHurtubise was added to the Reds 40-man roster this past offseason after absolutely setting the minor leagues on fire with his stellar play in 2023. Hurtubise hit .330/.479/.482 while splitting time in both Double-A Chattanooga and Triple-A Louisville.\nNick Martini is also an option to replace TJ Friedl on the Reds Opening Day roster\nBubba Thompson is another option, but being a right-handed hitter probably pushes him out of the conversation. If the Reds prefer to run a combination of Benson and Fairchild out in center field, then Nick Martini may be the benefactor and find his way onto the Opening Day roster.\nMartini hasn't connected often this spring, but when he has, the veteran has launched balls into orbit. Martini has just four hits during Cactus League play this spring, but three of the four have left the yard.\nHurtubise is a dark horse to snag that final roster spot, and has already been reassigned to minor league camp. But that doesn't preclude his name from being added to the Reds Opening Day roster. While the Reds roster isn't overflowing with options to replace Friedl, Cincinnati has enough young talent to take his place in center field until the 28-year-old is fully healthy.",

Players like Tejay Antone and Frankie Montas have gone down in-season, while the likes Matt McLain and Ian Gibaut have been out since Opening Day.\nBut lately, a rash of illnesses have flooded the Reds clubhouse. Christian Encarnacion-Strand and Jeimer Candelario have missed time, but more recently Jonathan India, Justin Wilson, and Jake Fraley have been unavailable.\nReds manager David Bell has been able to weather the storm, and Cincinnati has won four of their last five games, so the impact hasn't been too severe. But with the schedule getting more difficult, it sure would be good to have a full compliment of players at the ready.\nReds News: TJ Friedl injury update\nOne good tidbit of information on the injury front is that TJ Friedl is preparing for a return to the diamond sooner rather than later. The Reds centerfielder has been on the shelf with a wrist injury he suffered during spring training, but is currently rehabbing out in Arizona.\nFriedl is said to be ramping up baseball activities and, according to Bell, is much further ahead than expected. Once Friedl is full-go, the Reds will likely send him on a rehab assignment with a return date likely targeted for May.\nReds News: Will Benson ends his slump\nWill Benson entered Tuesday night's game against the Philadelphia Phillies having gone 0-for-16. The Reds outfielder experienced similar struggles during the beginning of the 2023 season and was sent to Triple-A Louisville in order to get his swing right.\nThankfully that wasn't necessary this time, as Benson ended what eventually turned into an 0-for-18 skid with a single during Tuesday's game at Great American Ball Park. The Reds are hopeful that Benson catches a wave of momentum with the hitless streak now a thing of the past.\nReds News: Santiago Espinal recorded 1st HR since being traded to Cincy\nThe Reds made a preseason trade with the Toronto Blue Jays after learning the details of Matt McLain's injury. Reds President of Baseball Operations Nick Krall swung a deal for infielder Santiago Espinal, but the former All-Star has had a rough go at the outset of his Cincinnati tenure.\nThat all ended on Tuesday night against the Phillies. Espinal was 3-for-4 with a home run. The round tripper came just after Espinal was almost hit by a pitch. Phillies reliever Ricardo Pinto came up and in with his first pitch, and after getting back in the batters' box, Espinal rocketed his first homer as a Red over the wall in left field.",

After quickly outgrowing that first space, they moved to the 2,500 square foot shop in the Greater Cincinnati area where their company, Peachy and Vintage, currently operates. The duo placed second in the KY Pitch competition in 2022 and were recognized as Cincy Inno 5 Under 25 winners in 2023.\nEmil Barr\n21 | Founder, Step Up Social\nLike many startups, Step Up Social was founded in Emil Barr\u2019s college dorm room in 2021. The marketing agency\u2014which specializes in short-form videos for TikTok and Instagram Reels\u2014brought in $550,000 in 2023 revenue and projects doubling that in 2024. Clients include Hulk Hogan, P&G and Decker's Brands. In July, Step Up Social merged with Los Angeles-based Candid Network, which counts clients like Shopify, Nike and Banana Republic. Barr is also the founded Flashpass, a social media certification company that provides social media training for businesses through Ohio\u2019s TechCred program.

        "title": "P&G stock deserves to be down after a messy quarter \u2014 but not this much",
        "article": "Procter & Gamble on Tuesday reported a messy fiscal fourth quarter, putting shares of the Tide detergent and Pampers maker on pace for their worst day in two years. The stock is understandably down, but this is not a thesis-changing report. Revenue in three months ended June 30 totaled $20.53 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $20.74 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Sales were essentially flat year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) rose 2% on an annual basis to $1.40, topping estimates by 3 cents, LSEG data showed. Procter & Gamble Why we own it : We like P & G because demand for its household and personal care products does not tend to fluctuate based on the economy. It has effectively navigated high inflation over the past two years. It's the kind of defensive stock that is good to own while the economy slows. Competitors : Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever Weight in Club portfolio : 2.35% Most recent buy : April 3, 2024 Initiated : April 7, 2022 Bottom line It's not surprising that shares of Procter & Gamble are lower after reporting a mixed quarter with guidance for its fiscal 2025 that merely met expectations \u2014 especially considering the stock closed Monday at a record high of $169.93. But the magnitude of Tuesday's declines, down about 6%, is excessive. Nothing in Tuesday's report suggests that P & G \u2014 a well-run company with a consistent track record of shareholder returns and earnings growth \u2014 is straying from its long-term course. Some of P & G's slide may simply be that investors are looking for more exciting stories at this point in the economic and interest-rate cycle. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut rates at its September meeting, a buzzier story looks like fellow Club holding Stanley Black & Decker , up nearly 8% on the back of its earnings report Tuesday. \"I don't want you to outthink it: Procter is a much better company than 99% of the companies you could buy today,\" Jim Cramer said on Tuesday's Morning Meeting. \"But you don't buy consistency at this point in the cycle. You buy possible explosive earnings [like] Stanley Black & Decker.\" Investors may also be worried that P & G could struggle to meet its guidance if consumer spending in the U.S. and Western Europe weakens in the coming quarters. On the call, management sounded upbeat on the current state of the consumer, saying that private-label market share in North America and Europe remains in line with pre-pandemic levels, and noting that its products are essential everyday items that people need no matter the economic conditions. Despite that, P & G had a spotty quarter, which could give fuel to investors worried that a deterioration in the consumer would make its guidance harder to achieve. Nevertheless, P & G still fills an important role in a diversified portfolio, and its business is on solid footing. Consider this: The vast majority of P & G's portfolio \u2014 executives identified it as 85% \u2014 is performing in line with management's expectations. That includes North America, where organic sales grew 4%, and Europe, where organic sales increased 2% despite a difficult 12% comparison in the year-ago period. After leaning on price hikes to boost the top line, volumes are growing again the balance of its markets, which is \"the shift we needed to see,\" CFO Andre Schulten said. In fact, P & G reported a companywide 2% increase in organic volume, its first time reporting growth for that metric since third quarter of fiscal year 2022. Additionally, gross margins are at record levels, which is enabling the company to invest in marketing and product innovation to drive future sales. The remaining 15% of the business, including the Chinese and Middle Eastern markets, continues to grapple with headwinds. In China, for example, its Japan-based SK-II skin-care brand remains under pressure from a rise in anti-Japanese sentiment that bubbled up last year in addition to sluggishness in the country's economy overall. And geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are still having an impact on Western retailers, executives said. Those dynamics have weighed on results in recent quarters and will continue to do so in the first half of P & G's fiscal 2025, but eventually the company will get to a point where it's facing easier year-over-year comparisons, leading to improved growth rates. In the case of SK-II, specifically, management said absolute volumes and dollars are stabilizing \u2014 it's just lower levels than a year ago. That helps explain how you get organic sales in China down 9%, albeit a slight sequential improvement from the 10% drop in the third quarter. In the second half of fiscal 2025, though, P & G will benefit from lapping the sales declines. And bigger picture, management said an improvement in the underlying situations in China and Middle East would enable P & G to deliver results above the midpoint of their 2025 guidance ranges. Of course, things could take a turn for the worse, but the company is \"centered on a realistic expectation of outcomes,\" CEO Jon Moeller said. Considering everything in Tuesday's report, we're reiterating our 2 rating and $170 price target on P & G. Jim said he would like to see P & G get closer to $156 a share before getting interested in buying back some of the 70 shares we sold at $166.63 each in May. PG YTD mountain Procter & Gamble's year-to-date stock performance. Guidance P & G expects total sales to grow between 2% and 4% in fiscal 2025, which at the midpoint matches expectations of 3%. Organic sales are expected to grow in the range of 3% to 5%. Executives said the top line growth will be fueled by a balance mixed between volume and price increases. Meanwhile, the company is guiding for full-year core earnings per share between $6.91 and $7.05, representing 5% to 7% year-over-year growth. The midpoint of $6.98 is basically in line with the $6.97 expected by analysts. Baked into those projections are commodity and currency headwinds of roughly $500 million after taxes, which will pressure core EPS by 20 cents a share, according to P & G. Quarterly results Of course, it would be better to see less red in the earnings table above, but none of the line-item misses are truly alarming. And the few better-than-expected metrics \u2014 most notably, earnings per share and free cash flow \u2014 are among the most important ones for a mature company like P & G. Free cash flow in particular is what enables P & G to pay its dividend, which has increased for 68 straight years, and steadily repurchase shares. Beauty was the only segment to significantly fall short of Wall Street expectations, though it's home to the SK-II brand. An given the aforementioned challenges in China, combined with a generally weaker environment for beauty sales, it's not a shock to see the miss here. The segment with the second-biggest miss was Baby, Feminine & Family Care, which was dragged down by poor performance in the Baby Care unit, specifically. It saw a mid-single digit decrease in organic sales because of market-share losses for its Luvs diapers. While its premium Pampers brand performed well, management said the less-expensive Luvs brand was hurt by postponed innovation due to supply chain constraints. The company is getting that innovation into the marketplace, and executives expressed confidence Luvs will recover as a result. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long PG.

        "article": "Procter & Gamble Earnings: Sales Slowdown Spooks Investors\nDespite the drop in share prices, we still view P&G stock as overvalued.\nKey Morningstar Metrics for Procter & Gamble\n- Fair Value Estimate: $143.00\n- Morningstar Rating: 2 stars\n- Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide\n- Morningstar Uncertainty Rating: Low\nWhat We Thought of Procter & Gamble\u2019s Earnings\nThe market dogged Procter & Gamble PG after it closed the book on its second consecutive quarter of tepid sales performance, up just 2% on an organic basis in its fiscal fourth quarter (versus 3% growth in the prior quarter and the mid-to-high-single-digit-percentage jumps that have more recently characterized the business). Shares were down around 5%-6% in intraday trading.\nHowever, we expected sales growth would slow. Indeed, P&G\u2019s fiscal 2024 results and fiscal 2025 guidance for 3%-5% organic sales growth against 5%-7% EPS growth generally square with our preprint estimates, rendering our $143 per share fair value estimate largely unchanged (beyond time value). Although we still don\u2019t view the stock as a bargain, trading at a 10%-15% premium to our intrinsic valuation, we think investors should keep it on their radar, in case trepidation around intensifying competition and a waning macro landscape offer a more attractive entry point.\nWe attribute the stock\u2019s fall to continuing angst about the strength of consumer spending. Management insisted it isn\u2019t seeing material cracks, pointing to private-label share similar to pre-pandemic levels and continued volume growth (up 1% in the fourth quarter, versus flat in the third). While these pressures are likely to persist, we surmise P&G should remain above the fray, given its prudent strategic aims\u2014diligently spending behind its brands and capabilities to ensure its products stay top of mind with retailers and consumers, supporting its competitive edge. This underpins our forecast for P&G to direct around 13% of sales (more than $13 billion annually) on average to research, development, and marketing over our explicit forecast.\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

The fire department says the heat in the building and the humidity on the warm night were taking a toll on firefighters, so they were rotated to keep them cool and hydrated.\nWe\u2019re told a few firefighters got overheated from wearing their heavy gear in the warm temperatures and high humidity, but they\u2019re OK.\nNo firefighters were hurt from the fire attack, and no one working inside the building was hurt.\nThe fire is in the back of the plant on Quincy St. Some fire trucks staged at Green Bay Packaging nearby. No roads were closed.\nThe Green Bay Metro Fire Department received assistance from fire departments as far away as Manitowoc. They were also assisted by Procter & Gamble\u2019s response team.\nAt this time there\u2019s no dollar amount on the damage to the plant.\nExactly what caused the fire is under investigation, but at previous fires, the department has told us paper dust is prone to spontaneous combustion in paper mills\u2019 air handling systems.\nCopyright 2024 WBAY.

        "article": "Procter & Gamble Company (PG - Free Report) has reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year. Meanwhile, sales missed the consensus mark and were flat year over year. The company\u2019s organic sales grew year over year, driven by robust pricing and volume trends. Shares fell 4.8% in the key trading session on Jul 30, 2024.\nInside the Headline\nProcter & Gamble\u2019s core earnings of $1.40 per share increased 2% from the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37. Currency-neutral net earnings per share (EPS) rose 6% year over year. The company has reported net sales of $20.5 million, flat year over year. Sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.72 billion.\nThe increase in sales can be attributed to increases in pricing and volume of 1% each, offset by a negative currency impact of 2%. On an organic basis (excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange), revenues rose 2% year over year, backed by improved pricing and volume.\nChina, P&G\u2019s second-largest market, continues to struggle, according to a CNBC article. The company didn\u2019t disclose the region\u2019s quarterly volume, but organic sales in Greater China slumped 9%. Sluggish demand in China contributed to volume declines for P&G\u2019s beauty business.\nFor fiscal 2025, P&G anticipates core net earnings per share in a range of $6.91 to $7.05. The company reiterated its revenue outlook of 2% to 4% growth.\nETFs in Focus\nThe stock P&G has solid exposure to several consumer staples ETFs. These ETFs include iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (IYK - Free Report) , Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP - Free Report) , Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (FSTA - Free Report) and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC - Free Report) . These funds invest assets in the Procter & Gamble stock in the range of 17% to 12%.\nGenerally, when one stock accounts for more than 10% of an ETF's weight, its individual performance decides much of the fund\u2019s price movement. The P&G stock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Although the stock hails from a top-ranked (top 29%) Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials Industry and a bottom-ranked (bottom 6%) Zacks Consumer Staples Sector.\nAgainst this moderately-downbeat scenario, it is better to bet on Procter & Gamble through the ETF method as the basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks.\nSee More Zacks Research for These Tickers\nNormally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:\nProcter & Gamble Company (The) (PG) - free report >>\nConsumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) - free report >>\nVanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) - free report >>\niShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (IYK) - free report >>\nFidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (FSTA) - free report >>",

        "title": "Why Is The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) the Best Dividend Stock of All Time?",
        "article": "Why Is The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) the Best Dividend Stock of All Time?\nWe recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) stands against the other dividend stocks.\nDividend stocks aren\u2019t a quick fix for investing; they offer lasting rewards over time. Unfortunately, many investors miss the boat on this and expect to strike it rich overnight. When that doesn\u2019t pan out, they chase the latest stock market trends, ignoring the steady gains that dividend stocks can provide. This trend has been evident over the past year, with AI stocks taking the spotlight and leaving income stocks in the dust. However, there\u2019s a silver lining: many tech companies have begun offering dividends this year, highlighting their long-term potential.\nThe current yields of these tech stocks might be small, which leads many income investors to overlook their impressive growth records. This is unfortunate because dividend growth can significantly boost both long-term income and capital gains. Analysts believe that dividend growth and sustainability are more crucial than just the yield. For instance, Microsoft\u2019s roughly 864% return over a decade far outpaces the returns from non-tech stocks like AT&T and Chevron, despite their higher yields. The tech giant currently pays $0.75 per quarter and offers a dividend yield of 0.7%. However, you need to keep in mind that its quarterly dividend was $0.28 a decade ago and its dividend yield was 2.5%. Despite the nearly tripling its quarterly dividend, the stock's yield went down to 0.7% and that was a great thing for its dividend investors.\nDividend stocks are often compared not just with high-yield stocks but also with those that don\u2019t pay dividends to provide investors with a comprehensive view. According to data from Hartford Funds, from 1973 to 2023, dividend-paying companies offered an average annual return of 9.17%, while stocks without dividends only returned 4.27%. The report also noted that companies with stable dividends had an average return of 6.74%, which lagged behind the performance of companies that increased their dividends.\nWhile regularly increasing dividends is challenging, maintaining consistent payouts year after year is also no easy feat for companies. Analysts warn against yield traps\u2014stocks with high yields but unstable dividend policies. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, shared his views on dividend investing in a CNBC interview. He recommended focusing on top-quality companies, which often provide dividend yields of around 3% to 4%. These firms usually show steady growth in their dividend payments, boosting the annual income stream and helping to counteract inflation. He also pointed out that stocks with lower yields tend to be safer investments with more reliable payout structures.\nIn this article, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks of all time that have consistent records of paying dividends to shareholders.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this article, we scanned the list of companies that have paid dividends to shareholders for at least 75 years. From that list, we picked companies with dividend yields of above 2%, as of July 23. We analyzed these companies through their balance sheets and overall financial health to determine their dividend stability. Additionally, we assessed the sentiment of hedge funds for each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s Q1 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in these companies. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA happy couple viewing the products of this household and personal product company in a mass merchandiser store.\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 69\nDividend Yield as of July 23: 2.40%\nThe Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is an American multinational consumer goods company that specializes in consumer goods. The company is a strong dividend payer, with a dividend growth streak spanning over 68 years. In addition, it has regularly distributed dividends to shareholders for 134 years straight. The company has a strong cash position, indicating its ability to maintain its dividend policy while meeting its targets. In the latest quarter, it generated over $4 billion in operating cash flow, with adjusted free cash flow reaching $3.3 billion and a free cash flow productivity of 87%. The company expects adjusted free cash flow productivity to reach 90% and plans to distribute over $9 billion in dividends in 2024. As of July 23, the company has a dividend yield of 2.40%.\nIn July of this year, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) hit a new all-time high of $169 per share, exceeding its previous peak of about $168, which it achieved in June. This milestone is largely attributed to the company's strong execution. The company has consistently performed well, especially during inflationary periods, where it effectively implemented significant price hikes. For example, in fiscal 2023, the company achieved organic sales growth in every quarter.\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q1 2024, 69 hedge funds owned stakes in The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), down slightly from 71 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a total value of over $7.2 billion.\nOverall PG ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Dividend Stocks of All Time to see the other dividend stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of PG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than PG but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and 10 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\nDisclosure: None.

However, quarterly revenue of $20.53 billion, flat from a year earlier, fell short of the expected $20.74 billion.\nDisappointing demand weighed on the company\u2019s quarterly results. Lower sales of the super-premium SK-II brand and less demand in China have offset the growth from increased pricing in the Skin and Personal Care segment. The Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment also declined 1% in organic sales due to volume decline and increased pricing.\nThe household product manufacturer reported fiscal year 2024 revenue of $84 billion, an increase of two percent versus the prior year.

Adjusted earnings were $2.28 a share, up from $2.07 in Q1 and also exceeding the estimate of $2.16.\nThe reason behind investors' pessimism was a downbeat outlook.\nThe company lowered its 2024 profit outlook, projecting adjusted earnings per share of $7.94 to $8.04, compared to the previous guidance of $8.53 to $8.65. The downward revision is caused by the impact of its recent acquisition of EyeBio, a biotech firm specializing in ophthalmology.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks",

And it isn't just a casual fling.\n\"We wouldn't have to hide our love any more\u2026\" the eight-legged beast sensually drawled through the glass of her tank, inviting Deep to run away with her to the ocean. \"We could just be Kevin and Ambrosius.\"\nBut who is the sultry voice behind the sea creature? We won't keep you hanging any longer, because it's a doozy:\nIT'S TILDA SWINTON.\nNope, we didn't see it coming either. Even though we knew Swinton had been cast in the new season, we just didn't put four and four together.\nIt's hardly her first superhero appearance \u2013 she played the Ancient One in Doctor Strange and The Avengers: Endgame. But even so, she's better known for her roles in elevated, arthouse fare like We Need to Talk About Kevin and The Grand Budapest Hotel.\nBut then this kind of left-field decision is exactly why we love her.\nThe Boys season four premieres its first three episodes this Thursday (June 13) on Prime Video, with new episodes weekly. Seasons 1-3 and spin-off Gen V are also streaming on Prime Video.\nYou Might Also Like",

Many actors are lucky to get one such career-making gig in a lifetime, but Crawford\u2019s current run as the aquatic antagonist The Deep in Amazon Prime\u2019s bloody, satirical hit The Boys got very close to reaching Gossip Girl\u2019s long life\u2014one season short, to be exact. \u201cI might be the only one who would do this show for another 10 years,\u201d he tells W over Zoom ahead of The Boys\u2019s fourth season premiere on Thursday. At this point, Crawford is used to donning a sleeveless wetsuit on the waterless set, reading lines alongside an anthropomorphized octopus, making an inappropriate comment to a woman (The Deep, not Crawford), and then heading home for the day. Not a bad existence.\nAnd even though The Boys will soon come to an end (creator Eric Kripke recently announced that the show\u2019s forthcoming fifth season will be its last), the spin-offs will live on. The show has already spawned an animated series, a handful of miniseries, and the young adult-led Gen V, in which Crawford\u2019s The Deep made a guest appearance in the first season. At some point, while parodying the world of Marvel, DC, and Disney, The Boys birthed a cinematic universe all on its own. Of course, those former entities are void of superhuman orgies and breast milk fetishes, but The Boys will be The Boys, right? \u201cWhen I first read the script for the show, the humor was really dark and right up my alley, but I didn\u2019t know if it would work tonally,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cWe thought it had a chance to find an audience, but for it to have this global popularity was a very pleasant surprise.\u201d Below, Crawford gets deep on The Deep, discusses his unwavering love for sushi, and reminisces on the good ol\u2019 days of Gossip Girl.\nIt was just announced that The Boys will end after its fifth season. How are you feeling about that?\nI feel like I could do five more seasons, I love the character so much, but Kripke knows best and there had been whispers about ending after five. It\u2019s tough to know when to stick the landing in TV and you don\u2019t want to overcook the storylines. It definitely will be sad. It\u2019s been one of the greatest rides of my life, but I\u2019m looking forward to going out with a bang.\nCan you believe you\u2019ve been doing this for almost seven years?\nI can't actually. It definitely flew by. It's a blessing to be a part of something that has this good of a run.\nIn your opinion, how has The Deep changed over the last four seasons? Or has he not changed and is that what makes him The Deep?\nI think he tries to change, but he ends up back in the same place. He only feels bad when he's been caught for something. That's when he starts to feel a tiny tinge of humility. But he's just so not self-aware, which is the funniest part about it for me. We all know people like that. He's just the privileged asshole, and it's fun to play that.\nDo you judge his choices, or do you have to view him through kinder eyes since you\u2019re the one playing him?\nI can't judge him. He\u2019s insecure. Like the X-Men, he feels like a freak. That\u2019s his sense of spite\u2014he feels like his powers are stupid. I envision him having a rough family life, and the only people he could really hang out with were the fish in the sea and the lobster down by the local pier, which is pathetic and sad.\nBefore taking on this role, were you an aquatic guy at all?\nNo, not at all, and I had no idea what to expect. I was like, \u201cCool, I got this wetsuit, I'm going to be in the water doing stunt work. It's going to be great.\u201d And there has been none of that. It\u2019s just me in a therapist's office, which is actually even funnier. For the most part, The Deep just bounces around and does absolutely nothing. But I finally did get some cool stuff to do in season four.\nSo I guess this role hasn\u2019t turned you into a seaman?\nI don't really need to know anything about the ocean. I actually did watch My Octopus Teacher back when it came out, and then going into season three, Kripke was like, \u201cHave you seen My Octopus Teacher? Because I have a really funny idea.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh God, what are you going to do?\u201d I was nervous about that, but they went there, and it was really funny.\nWhat about seafood? Have you been completely put off octopus?\nOh, I'll crush some sushi, but, honestly, octopus grosses me out now. I'm not too big on it. I had to eat fake octopus over and over for that one scene last season. But some Sugarfish? I\u2019m always down.\nDo you think The Deep will ever escape the grip of Vaught and Homelander?\nI don't know if he wants to escape. I think he is a soldier through and through, and that's his identity. That's all he knows. He needs that validation from Homelander, and he needs to be told what to do. I think he's just a sycophant who feels good following those orders and needs a leader, a cult leader almost, in Homelander. That's his pathetic nature.\nWould you ever be interested in delving into his backstory to understand why he is the way he is?\nLet's pitch a spinoff. But if you did that, you would probably need a redemption arc for The Deep, and I don\u2019t know if that would really work. Can you really redeem him?\nWhat about the suit? It doesn\u2019t look very comfortable. Do you ever get sick of it?\nIt's not comfortable after a while. In fact, I just had to put it on for something recently, and the costumer was like, \u201cBy the way, we don't even make this material anymore because it's so ridiculous.\u201d It's a wetsuit, but I\u2019m not in the water. At least it's sleeveless, I guess. It's actually not a problem, though, because they keep the studios really cold, and I'm warm by nature, so it's fine inside. The second we get outside in any sun, though, I'm drenched.\nOK, time for some Culture Diet questions. Are you a fan of DC or Marvel?\nI was when I was a kid. I used to collect these 12-inch dolls: I got Superman when I was really little, then Batman, and then Spider-Man. I read some comics and watched the movies when they first came out with Iron Man and the original Toby McGuire Spider-Man, but I got burnt out a little bit, to be honest. I'm not really a big superhero watcher anymore.\nWhat was the last movie you watched?\nI just re-subscribed to the Criterion Channel so I watched Martin Scorsese's After Hours. Then I also recently rewatched Dumb and Dumber. So, two very different movies. I was cracking up, remembering how old I was when I first saw Dumb and Dumber. Stuff like that informs The Deep in a way\u2014Zoolander, Anchorman\u2014that's the kind of stuff I grew up on, so I still love all those types of comedies.\nWe, of course, have to discuss Gossip Girl at least briefly. Do you ever miss playing Nate?\nNot really. I'll say I miss the people, and I miss being on set. I do miss being in scenes with Ed [Westwick] because we would crack each other up, and I loved literally everyone on that show: Penn [Badgley], Leighton [Meester], Blake [Lively], Taylor [Momson], Connor [Paolo], the actors that played my parents. We were all super close. That was like our college experience in a way. I was in college for a year and a half, and then I got into acting, and boom, went to New York City, which was pretty crazy. It was a wild time in our life.\nDo you still see the cast at all? I think I saw you were with Ed recently.\nI did see Ed recently. I saw him in Europe and we reconnected a little bit. He's living like an hour north of London. He's very rural up there with his family, and he's doing really well. So it was really good to see Eddie West. We used to be roommates back in the day when we were like 19 and 20 years old.\nWhy do you think that show was so popular and has had such incredible lasting power?\nI don\u2019t know, to be honest. It keeps getting these bumps because of the streaming. There\u2019s basically a whole new generation of fans now, and we are so grateful for that. I think there\u2019s something so consumable about it with no commercials on Netflix. It's a guilty pleasure thing, and people can just breeze through it.\n[Creators] Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage really know how to do that genre. Now, you have Euphoria, which I love, but it\u2019s pretty intense. I guess if you want something a little more PG, you can watch Gossip Girl. Which is funny\u2014we used to be the racy show, but not anymore.",

        "article": "Antony Starr and Chace Crawford Talk \u2018The Boys\u2019 Season 4 and The Seven\nMoviefone speaks with Antony Starr and Chace Crawford about 'The Boys' season 4. \u201cI\u2019m always curious about the motives of the characters.\u201d Starr said.\nPremiering on June 13th, Prime Video\u2019s hit superhero series \u2018The Boys\u2019 is back for another explosive fourth season. \u2018The Boys\u2019 is based on The New York Times best-selling comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, who also serve as executive producers and developed by executive producer and showrunner Eric Kripke.\nRelated Article: TV Review: 'The Boys' Season 3\nMoviefone recently had the pleasure of speaking with Antony Starr and Chace Crawford about season 4 of 'The Boys', Homelander's exploration into mortality and fatherhood, The Deep's new outlook on life, and the hierarchy within The Seven.\nYou can read the full interview below or click on the video player above to watch our interviews with Starr and Crawford, Erin Moriarty, Claudia Doumit, Karen Fukuyama and showrunner Eric Kripke.\nMoviefone: Antony, this season deals a lot with the past, and with Homelander specifically, he\u2019s dealing with having to face his own mortality and fatherhood. What has it been like for you to deep dive into that part of the character for the season?\nAntony Starr: Honestly, as a non-parent, it was great. I get to go into parenting without dealing with the responsibility of having a kid. I think season 4 started somewhere midway through season three with the idea of mortality and everything that comes along with that. That naturally led to legacy, which is where we pick up in season 4, and that\u2019s all about fatherhood and familial relationship. But I don\u2019t think Homelander is equipped. He just doesn\u2019t understand how that actually works. Loves the idea of it, but he just doesn\u2019t know how to make it function, which is arguably true of many people. I keep saying if you want to look at your present, look at your past. If you want to look at your future, look at your present, right? So the future is Ryan, and the present is him. The past is where we go in episode four, and that is all in order to make himself a better father in his eyes for Ryan, which is a very selfish move, actually. It\u2019s about his legacy. But he does love the kid, so there\u2019s that.\nMF: Chase, in this season The Deep gets some words of encouragement from Sage, a new member of The Seven, and after that he finds the courage to speak up. What is something about this season that you\u2019re excited to explore for The Deep?\nChase Crawford: It was exactly what you just mentioned, to be honest. I mean, Sage obviously has super intelligence, hyper intelligence, and she knows how to play 4D chess, and she\u2019s manipulating him a little bit. But I do think it\u2019s funny that any compliment he takes, he\u2019s like, \u201cThank you.\u201d He really takes it to heart. It means a lot to him if someone, especially another superhero, and then of course, he\u2019s attracted to her after that. Just a sucker for flattery. But I do like that he\u2019s testing the bounds of his emotional world and sort of taking it out on other people. It just makes it interesting that he\u2019s leaning into a bit of what Homelander leans into and being aggressive, and liking it in a way and really saying, \u201cI\u2019ve already done this thing. I\u2019ve already done murders. I\u2019m doing everything.\u201d It\u2019s ridiculous what he\u2019s willing to do for Homelander, but it\u2019s been fun to explore a new dimension of The Deep and also his relationship.\nMF: Finally, Antony, can you talk about the hierarchy within The Seven and each of their motivations?\nAS: It\u2019s such a hierarchy in The Seven, everyone\u2019s trying to ascend. It\u2019s like a wolf pack constantly trying to get over each other. I\u2019m always curious about the motives of the characters on this show because I think it\u2019s always blurred. But I think it\u2019s really interesting that all the superheroes are really self-motivated, and all the anarchists, per se, are really doing something. They\u2019re really altruistic, and they want to do something for the masses, except Butcher, who\u2019s a serial killer who wants to kill me because he thinks I did something that I didn\u2019t do.\nWhat Is The Plot Of \u2018The Boys\u2019?\nIn Season 4, the world is on the brink. Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is closer than ever to the Oval Office and under the muscly thumb of Homelander (Antony Starr), who is consolidating his power. Butcher (Karl Urban), with only months to live, has lost Becca\u2019s son as well as his job as The Boys\u2019 leader. The rest of the team are fed up with his lies. With the stakes higher than ever, they have to find a way to work together and save the world before it\u2019s too late.\nWho Is In the Cast of \u2018The Boys\u2019?\n- Karl Urban as Billy Butcher\n- Jack Quaid as Hughie Campbell\n- Antony Starr as Homelander\n- Erin Moriarty as Starlight\n- Jessie T. Usher as A-Train\n- Laz Alonzo as M.M.\n- Chace Crawford as the Deep\n- Tomer Capone as Frenchie\n- Karen Fukuhara as the Female\n- Colby Minifie as Ashley Barrett\n- Claudia Doumit as Victoria Neuman\n- Susan Heyward as Sister Sage\n- Valorie Curry as Firecracker\n- Jeffrey Dean Morgan\nAll Series in 'The Boys' Franchise:\n- 'The Boys' (2019 - 2022)\n- 'Prime Rewind: Inside The Boys' (2020)\n- 'The Boys Presents: Diabolical' (2022)\n- 'Gen V' (2023)",

        "title": "The Boys Season 4: Chace Crawford Teases The Deep's Journey",
        "article": "Plotting and scheming has never been The Deep\u2019s speciality, but Chace Crawford told TheWrap that isn\u2019t stopping him from getting in the mix in \u201cThe Boys\u201d Season 4.\n\u201cHe\u2019s leaning into his power a bit more and copying Homelander a bit and leaning into his aggression and using manipulation as far as he knows how to manipulate,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cI think he\u2019s playing checkers while everyone else is playing chess or 3D chess.\u201d\nThe Deep is back in The Seven beginning in Season 4 after last season saw him struggling through a messy marriage and divorce and public ridicule for being in a relationship with an octopus. Now he\u2019s doing whatever he can to stay in Homelander\u2019s (Antony Starr) good graces while also trying to take back some control in his life.\nBy the end of Episode 3, he\u2019s also growing closer to Sister Sage (Susan Heyward). Crawford said Deep just \u201cwants to be a real boy so bad\u201d and likes the idea that a human is into him and \u201csees\u201d him rather than just an octopus. In reality, she is just using him as part of a larger game.\nIn a recent interview, Crawford went, well, deep, on The Deep\u2019s mindset in Season 4, his subservience to Homelander, unknowingly working with Tilda Swinton and more.\nNote: The following story contains spoilers \u201cThe Boys\u201d Season 4 Episodes 1-3.\nMentally, where is The Deep mentally at the beginning of \u201cThe Boys\u201d Season 4?\nI think he\u2019s happy to be back in the fold, back in The Seven. Leaving off in Season 3, he kinda crossed this ethical line, this moral boundary for himself he didn\u2019t realize he was quite capable of.\nI think he\u2019s doing whatever he can to kind of cling on to his identity within The Seven. Part of him is probably scared, he\u2019s coming out of this bad marriage and this relationship with this octopus, which is really funny.\nHe\u2019s leaning into his power a bit more and copying Homelander a bit and leaning into his aggression and using manipulation as far as he knows how to manipulate. I think he\u2019s playing checkers while everyone else is playing chess or 3D chess. He\u2019s still insecure and nervous about his place in the world.\nDespite having wavering opinions on The Seven, why do you think The Deep needs Homelander\u2019s validation so badly?\nI think there\u2019s some interesting father figure issues there, and he knows that Homelander can kill him, so I think that might be a justification in his mind.\nI think The Deep\u2019s not a guy who\u2019s a leader. He does well in a system where he\u2019s told what to do \u2013 very simple instructions and he follows those out. Like a lot of people, he\u2019ll just sort of follow along and try to do what he can to maintain his equilibrium and the status quo.\nThe scene at the end of Episode 1 with the baseball bats is a great example of him following simple instructions, but does he lean more into being a \u201cyes\u201d man or being afraid?\nI think a bit of both, but it gives him permission now to do it so he starts to like it a little bit. It\u2019s cathartic when he doesn\u2019t even realize what\u2019s happening. He\u2019s getting to use his power, his strength to carry out these things and it almost starts to feel good in a messed up way.\nHe\u2019s being bullied by Homelander but he\u2019s also becoming the bully. He\u2019s realizing he can become the bully to people weaker than him.\nYou said The Deep isn\u2019t a leader, but when it comes to the hyper-violent buddy cop nature to his and the new Black Noir\u2019s relationship, he\u2019s in the driver seat. What can viewers expect from their dynamic going forward?\nThe Deep loves it, because he\u2019s like, \u201cFinally there\u2019s a newbie here who\u2019s kind of a pushover, and I can be like listen man this is the way of the world.\u201d He can imitate what Homelander has done to him.\nHe stands up to Ashley for the first time ever in the opening episodes. Would he have done it without Sage pushing him to?\nI think Sage is the catalyst. The need to do it and act out has been inside of him, he just didn\u2019t recognize it. It took her to kind of create a light bulb moment to say, \u201cF\u2013k her, I can put her in her place, she\u2019s not a superhero. I\u2019m the Lord of the Seven Seas.\u201d\nSage wasn\u2019t being a friend though, right? This was her playing chess and allowing The Deep to play checkers.\nOh, totally. It\u2019s her playing chess but he takes it as \u201coh somebody sees me\u201d and he falls for her. It\u2019s doubly funny because it\u2019s \u201cthe first person who sees me and gets it\u201d when obviously that\u2019s her power too. She\u2019s insanely smart and playing 3D chess with him. It\u2019s a great relationship between those two.\nWhat can you tease of that relationship going forward?\nIt\u2019s such a f\u2013ked up thing. They\u2019re two people who are so wrong for each other. They\u2019re both just there and there\u2019s a physical attraction. I do think Deep needs a mommy, needs to be mothered in a way, and she becomes this safe haven she gravitates toward.\nHe thinks, \u201cShe has my best interest in mind, she sees me and she got me the Bloomin\u2019 Onion.\u201d I think he\u2019s just so starved for connection. I think he\u2019s always wanted to relate to humans, but felt very insecure about it obviously \u2013 he\u2019s got damage from his gills, he thinks he\u2019s a freak. He\u2019s always very closed off. So to have someone there physically that\u2019s different from Ambrosius the octopus as well. Someone who\u2019s really smart, too. He\u2019s probably really flattered. In his mind, she\u2019s really into him. It gives him confidence.\nThe scene with Ambrosius in Episode 3 is a bit heartbreaking. Is he sad or ashamed for keeping her hidden in a closet?\nIt\u2019s that thing again where he wants to be a real boy so bad. He doesn\u2019t want a connection with an octopus but it is giving him that emotional support. It\u2019s sad, it\u2019s sad that she\u2019s his secret.\nHe\u2019s been verbally told by Homelander to \u201cget rid of that f\u2013king thing.\u201d But sometimes we cling to something until we find something else. So when he finds Sage, it\u2019s an instant pushing away of this part of himself that he doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge.\nDid you know when you were reading the scripts or shooting that Tilda Swinton would be voicing Ambrosius?\nNo, I had no idea. Kripke always said he wanted to get the most Oscar-winning British actor around, and there are only like four of them in the world. He texted me, like, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone but you\u2019re going to get a kick out of this.\u201d\nThat she was willing to come and play with us, I\u2019m sure she was like, \u201cWell let me see the scene first.\u201d It\u2019s a great scene, it\u2019s a great scene for The Deep and it\u2019s kinda like a marriage story.\nShould fans feel bad for The Deep at this point?\nI think that\u2019s the burden put on the people. It\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to but \u2026\u201d It\u2019s almost hard not to, and that\u2019s what Kripke wants to do is humanize them. It\u2019s not to redeem them but to humanize and let you make that decision. I think that\u2019s part of the success of the show. It\u2019s always been driven by the characters. It\u2019s not just black and white\n'The Boys' to End With Season 5",

        "title": "Stars of The Boys Interview with Men's Health About Season 4",
        "article": "This story is part of The Men\u2019s Health Amazing, Uncanny, All-Star Guide to Comics, where we dive into some of the most illustrative conversations about the comic books and graphic novels that have influenced so much of our culture and lives. Read our next hand-selected issue here.\nTHERE'S USUALLY QUITE a bit of tension in the air when Antony Starr, Chace Crawford, and Jessie T. Usher share the screen. As grounded, realistic takes on iconic superhero characters in Prime Video's superhero satire mega-hit The Boys (Starr's Homelander is a stand-in for Superman, Crawford's The Deep is Aquaman, and Usher's A-Train is The Flash), they effectively make up a trio of characters who exist, at kindest, in the show's morally gray area, and at most realistic, closer to the categorization of \"pure evil.\"\nTheir time together usually consists of the latter two quietly squirming, scared shitless of what Homelander is capable of doing; Starr plays his version of the strongest \"hero\" alive as the most dangerous and terrifying sociopath you've ever seen, packaged with a chilly personality and surprising emotional depth when someone knows how to push his buttons (which tend to involve daddy issues, mommy issues, and, uh, milk). This doesn't only create one of the most memorable villains in recent television history, but an environment of terror and dread that travels with him at all times. In effect, Homelander is a walking nuclear bomb (an ironic descriptor, considering the show literally had a human weapon of massive destruction in its chaotic third season).\nYou'd never pick up on any of that from a conversation with the actors who play The Boys's three most menacing Supes; the trio are quick to joke, constantly laughing, zipping one-liners, and finishing each other's sentences. After three full seasons of intense, darkly funny, and always-engaging television (and a fourth set to debut on June 13), they've picked up a chemistry that simply can't be faked\u2014or simulated with any kind of superpower.\n\"I just try to make him laugh before any scene,\" Crawford says with a big smile on his face during our lengthy Zoom conversation, gesturing toward Starr with a bracelet clad to his left wrist, wearing a gray button-down shirt.\nStarr, sitting just to Crawford's right, doesn't look anything like the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, muscle-suited Homelander. Instead, his hair is dark, his eyes covered by tinted sunglasses, his face obstructed by a well-grown goatee. He doesn't look like much like his character at all\u2014and, thankfully, doesn't act much like him either. \"I can\u2019t stop laughing if I'm in a scene with these two,\" he says, gesturing toward both Crawford and Usher.\nUsher, wearing a button-down shirt with the top few buttons undone to reveal a black T-shirt underneath, can only laugh, pointing toward the other two and beginning to hint at a moment in the show's upcoming fourth season. \"You guys have a really...\"\nStarr steps back in: \"We have a scene, the three of us, which I can't tell you about, but it's gold,\" he says, before explaining the difficulty in coming back year after year with fresh ideas for a prestige television show. \"There's a different requirement, and oh man, having been in lots of different situations in my career, this is a godsend. It's very easy to do interviews and be around each other, because we all genuinely have a like for each other.\"\nAs The Boys enters its fourth season\u2014a time when some shows start to run out of steam, others begin to wrap up, and others are, quite frankly, running on empty\u2014these guys are as energized and excited as ever. Excited about the show, excited about each other, excited about the world they get to play in. They aren't just actors doing a job (they've all done that before); they're legitimately psyched.\n\"Even if they end it, I'm going to keep filming,\" Crawford says, prompting laughter from everyone.\n\"We're just going to make everyone stick around,\" Starr adds. \"It's going to be a YouTube channel.\"\nWhile we can't confirm the creation of an unofficial The Boys YouTube channel, we can confirm that we had a long, sprawling, and revealing conversation with Starr, Crawford, and Usher, touching on just about everything under the ever-expansive umbrella of The Boys. And as we approach Season 4\u2014and things continue to get bigger and crazier than ever\u2014it's a conversation these three were excited to dive into.\nMEN\u2019S HEALTH: In Season 4, how do you continue to up the ante from everything else we've already seen?\nJESSIE T. USHER: We've been diving deeper into these characters year after year. There's a deeper understanding of what they're all going through.\nMH: Can you tease the most exciting stuff you got up to this season?\nCHACE CRAWFORD: Oh man, I don't know. The Deep\u2019s got a great storyline this year, though.\nANTONY STARR: It's difficult to do without spoiling. But what I will say is, I've done some very strange things in my career, and there\u2019s nothing as strange as one particular scene I did in Season 4. I cannot wait to be able to talk about it and explain why.\nMH: For this character, that's really saying something.\nAS: I agree. Across the board, I know some of the stuff these guys got up to, and the fans are not going to be disappointed.\nCC: Supposedly, I crossed the line.\nJTU: We tip-toed on the line quite a bit, that's for sure.\nMH: Where do you guys personally place that line when making the show? Was there anything that made you hesitate a bit?\nCC: The octopus thing. I was a little like... \u2018I don't know about this...\u2019 at first. But, yeah, it was good. I mean, [Showrunner Eric Kripke's] door is always open, so he was very friendly and like, \u2018You can do whatever you want. We can shoot it however you want to shoot it.\u2019 We changed some things around, and made it more comfortable, but it ended up being funny and brilliant and hilarious.\nAS: That's one of the things I've learned about the show\u2014it started with The Deep, actually. It started with you riding Lucy the Whale. I remember reading that. It was Season 2, and I remember thinking, \u2018Oh wow, this is too much. This is not\u2014\u2019\nCC: We've jumped the shark.\nAS: Yeah, we've jumped the shark and it's only Season 2. And then when I saw it, it literally became my favorite scene, and is one of my favorite scenes of the show.\nCC: Is it?\nAS: So absurd.\nJTU: And you come out of the water.\nAS: Oh, it's crazy. What it told me, though, is whenever I read those scenes\u2014like in Season 3, there was Termite exploding the guy from the inside. Whenever I read these scenes and I think, \u2018Oh, we're pushing too far,\u2019 they end up being my favorite scenes. So, I reserve all judgment now, and just trust Eric and the writing team. It seems to be paying off.\nJTU: We trust the process. Or maybe we've just gotten numb to how wild this show can actually be.\nAS: They're also not going to listen to us if we complain [All laugh.]. Just shut up and look forward!\nJTU: They take good care of us, though. They put us in really bizarre situations, but they make sure everybody's comfortable, and they're pretty reassuring about not doing anything that's going to come across in a bad way. They just have an incredible vision for pushing the boundary.\nMH: Prior to The Boys, you guys have all been on separate multi-season television shows. How has this show differed from those experiences?\nCC: For me, it's completely different. I was a teen in my 20s [in Gossip Girl, which aired on the CW from 2007 to 2012]. It was a teen type of show, very formulaic, and it was very like, \u2018Hit your mark and do this.\u2019 With this one, it's very freeing, and especially with [Antony Starr] working, he's very immersive. They really let us choreograph our own way, and improv, and go to different levels. It's a totally different way of working for me. I love it.\nJTU: Freeing is the key word. If there's a thought that comes to my mind, sure, I'm just going to pitch it. Whereas some other shows you might think, \u2018I don't know if I want to pitch that. That might not be the tone\u2019\" But here we're like, \u2018You know what? Who knows? They might adapt this now, they might use it later.\u2019 But whatever comes to mind, you feel comfortable. And I trust that if I throw something randomly at these guys, they can hit it right back to you. You know what I mean? I've seen it time and time again.\nAS: Eric set the tone for that right at the beginning. He said, \u2018If you\u2019ve got any ideas, pitch them. I'm always happy to steal other people\u2019s ideas and claim credit.\" [All laugh.]\nHe's super collaborative. He also said he has a \u2018No Assholes\u2019 policy, and has been true to his word on that. The people that we've had in as guests\u2014we had Jensen [Ackles] coming in, now we've got Jeffrey Dean Morgan\u2014they're all such good people. This is a very unique experience, and we're all making the most of it while we've got it. I think we're all going to miss it when it eventually... everything runs its course, but that'll be a sad day.\nMH: We've already talked about how the show can be so intense with all this violence and vulgarity and everything you can imagine. How do you prepare to get into the headspace for all of that?\nJTU: I don't know if there's a way to mentally prepare for it.\nAS: It's interesting, because I did a show once, and the character on the show was going through some really severe mental health issues. I didn't realize how much that affected me on set, but I had people saying to me that they hated when I was on set, because the material was so dark, and it was just so intense. I think there's a bit of bleed that comes through.\nI'm really interested in mental health, and promoting positive mental health, and I think what I've done with the character is really try to approach it in a way where, yes, he's dark, he's the villain. But he's also mentally unwell, and it's the result of damage. Honoring that is important to me, and I think people relate to it because of that as well. There's a lot of honesty in the characters.\nCC: I just have to prepare mentally when they put me in those Deep tighty-whities. That\u2019s just\u2026 [Antony laughs.] And physically, I\u2019ve got to keep the arms a little bit toned, and that's it.\nMH: Well, you guys are playing superheroes, after all. Before you start filming, do you ramp up your workout routines?\nJTU: The interesting thing about that is the season I decided I was going to ramp it up, I regretted it the most. I was like, \u2018All right, let me shred up and do my thing,\u2019 and then I got Episode 1 of Season 3 and it was like, \u2018A-Train's fat.\u2019 I'm like, \u2018Well, damn. You guys should have told me to be fat. I would've gone and eaten more hot dogs and stuff.\u2019 I did all this work, and then they stuffed me in a fat suit because I had literally lost fat.\nCC: I didn't know that.\nJTU: Yeah, bro. I showed up finally with a six-pack again, and they were like, \u2018Nah, bro, we need him to be on the other side of this.'\nAS: I had the opposite experience. I'm a lean dude, so I was like, \u2018I'll try and get some muscle on.\u2019 And I got to the point where you're meant to cut weight\u2026 I don't know. I didn't get to that point. So, they made me wear a girdle.\nJTU: They made you wear a girdle?\nAS: Nothing inspires you to get in shape like two weeks before, doing camera tests, and they're like, \u2018We're just going to put this girdle on you.\u2019 I'm never wearing that girdle on camera. And sure enough, two weeks later, I fit nicely.\nCC: You\u2019ve got all the fake muscles, you're good. You\u2019ve got the whole suit.\nAS: I didn't know what I had to do and what I didn't, but it worked out all right. I'm a girdle-free zone.\nCC: My suit\u2019s pretty tight. I\u2019ve got to eat pretty clean when I'm doing the show. You know what I mean?\nMH: Right.\nCC: Tightening up the diet a little bit. I cook a lot more. I hit the gym.\nAS: We're pretty healthy people as well.\nMH: You all take your fitness and physiques very seriously. Does the costume evolve from season to season? What are your relationships like with the costumes, and how does that impact your own relationships with your bodies?\nCC: I'll tell you, for mine, they had a bunch of mockups. Of course, I come in, they're like, \u2018Oh, we chose the sleeveless one.\u2019 I'm like, \u2018Oh, great. Okay.\u2019 I took it upon myself. I'm like, \u2018Listen, I want to at least for one season try and get re-shredded.\u2019 So, I tried to. But I got some butt pads, some thigh pads. There are some muscle calves in there. It helps me out a little bit. I mean, he's [point to Antony] got a full muscle suit.\nAS: Yeah, I set the bar low.\nCC: He\u2019s got a whole cooling system in there.\nJTU: 100% coverage.\nAS: Just in case we went more than one season, I was like, \u2018Don't set up any expectations.\u2019\nJTU: My suit has changed from Season 1, more so for comfort than anything. They haven't changed many of the aesthetics about the suit or the way that it looks, but the way it feels has changed a lot. My suit has probably gone down in weight by 50%, at least.\nCC: Really?\nJTU: The first mockup of the suit, believe it or not, if I ran in it, it fell apart.\nCC: Oh, wow.\nJTU: Yeah, which is crazy because he's a runner.\nAS: You're the athlete.\nJTU: As soon as I started running, the leg pieces were so heavy that they would break. The hardware just wasn't strong enough. They would actually break if I ran. Those things changed as time went on, and now the suit's fully functional. I could run the L.A. Marathon\u2014if I actually liked running that much.\nAS: That's a long run.\nJTU: I'm not doing it. There's no way. Don't get any ideas.\nMH: Jessie, you get some really interesting opportunities within your story for satire. I'm specifically thinking in Season 3 of the spoof of the Pepsi ad.\nJTU: That was an in-world spot that I believe was expanded on, eventually, into a full-fledged spoof commercial of the entire Pepsi campaign. Initially, I think that was just supposed to be a blip. Just something we saw a piece of, and then it just got built out from there. That was one of those moments where I felt like, \u2018They're not really going to\u2026\u2019 You know what I mean? \u2018How far into a spoof are we going to take this?\u2019 And even down to the exact same shots and mimicking the lines and the tone of the original campaign, they went all the way. It's always that matter of, \u2018Okay, how far are we going to go?\u2019 And then they're always like, \u2018The furthest.\u2019\nAS: On that note, one of my favorite spoofs was the \u201cImagine\u201d video.\nJTU: Oh my gosh, I forgot about that.\nAS: I don't think I've ever laughed at anything in the show as much as that.\nJTU: When they cut it together from all the show\u2019s celebrities, it was incredible. The lengths that they go are the furthest. It's amazing.\nMH: The three of you share a lot of scenes together, but are you all as bonded with, say, Karl Urban or Jack Quaid? They're in their scenes together, and you guys rarely cross over.\nCC: It's like two different TV shows. But, at the same time, I hosted some fun parties at my house, and everyone shows up on a Friday night. But we're not sitting there playing backgammon with them\u2014their thing is backgammon in between scenes. I think we became close really quickly after Season 1. We worked together all the time.\nAS: 100%.\nCC: It was just different.\nAS: I've known Karl, from New Zealand, for 20 years, so I got really excited at the chance to work with him once I found out. I got cast before him, and I found out it was him and I was like, \u2018Amazing.\u2019 I always wanted to work with Karl, but he flew the coop, so to speak. But then, even with The Boys, I've never done a scene with [Tomer Capone, who plays Frenchie], and he gave me this little wrist thing [points to his own wrist], which I wear every day. It's a weirdly tight group of people, and to be honest, I've never experienced that\u2014not with this many people.\nJTU: For it to be such a big cast, and for us to spend so much time apart, it feels pretty close. There are some times where I'll be on set and the other side, The Boys, not the Supes, will be doing their thing, and I'll go watch, and it honestly feels like I'm a guest on a foreign show.[Laughs.] The tone is a little different, and it's like, \u2018Oh, wow.\u2019 I definitely prefer our side. We're having way more fun. [All laugh.]\nAS: They just want to get off set. They want to stop shooting to go play backgammon. [All laugh.]\nJTU: And we just can't wait to put the tights on. [All laugh.]\nCC: My favorite part.\nAS: Or take them off.\nJTU: Or take them off. I can\u2019t figure it out.\nMH: Does it being so rare make those crossover moments feel special?\nCC: It does. It feels like a big reunion.\nAS: In Season 3, I really enjoyed Erin Moriarty's character, Starlight, and Jack's character, Hughie. I was messing with them a lot, and that was a lot of fun, because there was a mutual disrespect between the characters. And then I love anytime me and Butcher butt heads\u2014that\u2019s my favorite stuff.\nJTU: Mine too. I love seeing you guys go at it.\nMH: Antony, coming from New Zealand, was it a challenge to learn so much about Superman, to become this perfect, evil satirization of an All-American hero?\nAS: New Zealand very much looks over at America as a big brother, and we're heavily influenced by pop culture from America, for better or worse. You can take that however you want. But we've all got a pretty good awareness of what superhero culture is, and we get all the same movies. There's a bit of delay, but for me it wasn't so much about that as treating it like any character I've done, which is building from the ground up, trying to make something three-dimensional\u2014and then he happens to be a superhero.\nThe trap for me, personally, and I discussed it with Eric and knew he agreed, was that I didn't want to fall into the mustache-twirling villain thing. I wanted it to be a three-dimensional character, that I don't want to say that people empathize with, but people understood the reasoning behind who and why this man is what he is. I think we've done that, and I think that's what conflicts people a lot. I get a lot of comments on social media that people somehow empathize, and feel sorry for this serial killer, really, this psychopath. We've had a lot of fun trying to create something a little more realistic.\nMH: I think you've been very successful in that. And like you said, the little nuggets we get each season, like learning about how he was conceived and learning about his past.\nAS: It's all about honoring that damage. I don't know anyone that doesn't have a bit of damage, and a bit of trauma, and a bit of baggage they're holding onto, as someone that's been through a hell of a lot. Because we're not bound to the same moral and ethical True North, our compass doesn't always point True North\u2014we got a lot more scope. We can go anywhere with these characters, but they don't have to be the good guy. In fact, they're the exact opposite.\nMH: Chace, The Deep starts as this parallel for the #MeToo movement, and over the successive seasons, he kind of gets closer and closer and is kind of inching towards a redemption arc, but never quite gets there. I'm curious for your read on his whole road through the show.\nCC: It was interesting, because when I got cast, I didn't know that they were going to do that scene. It was in the comics, and they wanted that moment for [Starlight's] character as a jumping off point of \u2018Never meet your heroes.\u2019 It turned out to be very harrowing, but I think the character's not so black and white, obviously.\nThe whole point, from Eric's perspective, was to show the gray area of all these characters, and The Deep is so very un-self-aware. He thought that was okay to do, because everyone does it. That's the hazing process for the new person. He's very backwards. He's very selfish, and narcissistic, and insecure. There\u2019s some comedic levity in the character, obviously, when he's really trying hard to help the dolphin, or come through and impress Homelander.\nBut the arc's been really good, and where it ends last season with him kind of crossing a line\u2026 where they went this year with it is very interesting. It's a new side of The Deep. I had a lot of fun playing him.\nAS: There's a lot of payoff as well. There's a lot of enjoyment and payoff for the audience, seeing The Deep get screwed over. Like, seeing him standing in a water park, drunk, screaming at children that they don't know what it's like at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.\nCC: That was my favorite. That was the best opening.\nAS: That's hysterical. There's so much fun in seeing the Deep get\u2014\nCC: A little bit of a comeuppance.\nAS: And it's really enjoyable.\nCC: His gills are so pretty. I mean, who can resist them?\nJTU: That's crazy.\nMH: This is a satire of the superhero films, as they have been for the last 15-20 years. There are some very specific and pointed moments, like when Homelander talks about a movie\u2019s \u201cJoss rewrites.\u201d Do you feel the need to keep up with the genre as it evolves in order to keep up with your role in the show?\nCC: I don't watch many of them, to be honest. I used to keep up with it, but there are just so many these days. Do you keep up with any of them?\nAS: I watch all of them.\nCC: Do you?\nAS: Yeah, I do. I mean, I've always been a fan of superhero... not so much graphic novels, but Marvel and DC. One thing I've always respected about our show and our relationship with it is that there's no us without them. And while we have a bit of fun with them, it's always a little tongue-in-cheek and a bit of a laugh. I don't think we're trying to mock anything, because I actually really enjoy those films and people love them.\nCC: We're not mocking them at all.\nAS: By the same token, I enjoy being part of a show that isn't a slave to the same masters as those shows. Our range is wide open.\nJTU: Wide open.\nAS: There are certain places they cannot go, because the characters have to stay morally upright.\nMH: That's an interesting distinction. We have this new Deadpool movie that's about to come out, and that's an R-rated Marvel movie. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that you guys can go even beyond an R-rated Marvel movie.\nAS: You still know with those movies that ultimately they're going to be doing the right thing. The moral compass will never shift from True North. You don't know what the hell's going to happen with us.\nJTU: That's what makes it so good.\nAS: It makes it really interesting, and not knowing makes it interesting for the audience.\nMH: Season 4 is heading towards more political satire, and the show has obviously touched on that quite a bit already. How do you approach the fans who still don't seem to understand?\nAS: There's been a lot of misunderstanding around Homelander, and despite our very public attempts to clear that up, it baffles me that people would miss the point of it. It's also something that's beyond our control. Even though there are obvious parallels to the real world, the show's never shied away from that. What I love about this show is that it's always been political.\nThis is not something new that we're trying to do to. We're not reinventing the wheel at all, because if you look at what was happening with the Supes, I believe Homelander had A-Train zipping around the world to try and create super villains so that we could get into the military, and part of getting into the military was talking to senators and dealing with the government. There's always been a political element in the show, and we've always, from Day 1, embraced all these real-life things. The show's always paralleled reality, and I don't think this is any exception. And yeah, of course this is a special moment in time, and as we have in other seasons, we're not shying away from it.\nMH: How often are you recognized? What do people say?\nCC: It's just so funny. They're like, \u201cDeeeeeeeep!\" from across the street. I've never had that in any other show or anything. I think it's hilarious. Then, I'd be walking, and I just hear \u2018Oh, there's a... Deeeeeeeep!\"\nJTU: I think at this point now, I get asked to race just about every day.\nCC: Really?\nJTU: Yeah, bro, all the time! They're like, \u2018Can we race just one time?\u2019 I'm like, \u2018No, straight up, we can't. I'm at Whole Foods. I'm not racing you down the hall. \u2019\nAS: I don't get anything. I look so dissimilar to my characters.\nCC: Yeah, the blonde hair.\nAS: Well, I wear a hat all the time. That\u2019s why I always wear hats. But I also have Clark Kent glasses, and my little beard over here, and Bob\u2019s your uncle, I don\u2019t get anything. That works for me.\nMH: We've talked about satire. For you guys individually, if Marvel or DC or any of those traditional superhero movies or shows ever came calling, is that something you would be interested in, or does The Boys scratch the itch?\nAS: This is for you guys\u2014I\u2019m too old.\nCC: Don\u2019t they say if you're ever a superhero in something else, it\u2019s not gonna come? They're not going to call.\nMH: I don\u2019t know\u2014I feel like we could disprove that one.\nJTU: I feel like the only way it could work, it would feel like a crossover. So, it'd have to be something Deadpool-ish where they're already pushing the envelope. You know what I mean? They can't clean us up enough\u2026\nCC: Yeah, they'd be like, \u2018You went way too far.\u2019\nJTU: The fans of MCU would call them out on that, so we\u2019ve got to serve the people.\nAS: If they could have me sitting in a chair, [I\u2019d be down.] I'm tired of doing stunts. [All laugh.] Sitting down, like, \u2018Hey, don't do this. Don't do that,\u2019 then I'm in. Otherwise, eh, I'm happy.\nThis interview has been edited for content and clarity.\nPRODUCTION CREDITS\nDirector: Dorenna Newton\nDirector of Photography: Danny Dwyer\nEditor: Kyle Orozovich\nAssistant Camera: Joey Kramer\nGaffer: Ben Trevey\nKey Grip: Logan Alesso,\nPA: Sophia Mastrodomenico\nCreative Director: Jamie Prokell\nArt Director: Matt Ryan\nEntertainment Director: Nojan Aminoshari\nThis is just one issue of The Amazing, Uncanny, All-Star Men's Health Guide to Comics.

        "article": "Warning: This article contains SPOILERS for The Boys season 4, episodes 1-3.\nSummary\n- The Deep's relationship with Ambrosius the octopus takes a sad turn in The Boys season 4.\n- Tilda Swinton, known for roles in the MCU and Hunger Games, voices The Deep's octopus in the new season.\n- Swinton's performance is tragic, as The Deep clearly doesn't care about Ambrosius the way she cares for him.\nChace Crawford reprises his role as The Deep in The Boys season 4, and the newest outing finds Crawford's character romantically entangled with an octopus \u2014 one who is voiced by an A-list movie star viewers may know. The Deep is The Boys' parody of Aquaman, and the Amazon show draws many jokes from his inappropriate relationships with sea creatures. The Deep's behavior is so bad that Homelander (Antony Starr) tells him to get rid of his octopus and confirms that he has done so at the beginning of season 4.\nBut while The Deep assures Homelander that he no longer has Ambrosius, the octopus remains in his quarters; she's just relegated to the closet rather than the large tank in his room. The Deep and Ambrosius discuss their relationship and her living situation during The Boys season 4's three-episode premiere. And if Ambrosius sounds familiar to viewers, that's because the person who voices her is a well-known movie star.\nThe Boys: 25 Differences Between The Comics & The Show\nThe Amazon superhero series The Boys is based on a comic book series of the same name. Some things were changed comparing the comic book vs. show.\nThe Deep's Octopus, Ambrosius, Is Voiced By Tilda Swinton\nThe Actor Is Known For Roles In The MCU, Hunger Games, And Chronicles Of Narnia\nThe Deep's octopus, Ambrosius, is voiced by movie star Tilda Swinton in The Boys season 4. Swinton is a big name in Hollywood, recognizable from roles like the Ancient One in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, President Coin in The Hunger Games movies, and the White Witch in The Chronicles of Narnia. The actor is also known for projects like Snowpiercer, The French Dispatch, The Grand Budapest Hotel, and Michael Clayton. Swinton doesn't appear in as many TV shows, which makes her part in The Boys that much more exciting.\nDespite Swinton's role in The Boys being an odd one, the actor brings her A-game to the part.\nDespite Swinton's role in The Boys being an odd one, the actor brings her A-game to the part. Viewers will feel for Ambrosius, who is yet another victim of The Deep in The Boys. Crawford's character becomes less likable with each season, and his treatment of his octopus is pretty terrible in season 4's three-episode premiere. While she hasn't met a fate like his former octopus, Timothy, Ambrosius is still at The Deep's mercy. And if Homelander finds out she's still in his living quarters, she could wind up worse off than Timothy.\nTilda Swinton Might Just Be The Boys' Most Impressive Guest Cameo Yet\nThe Actor's Awards Record & Major Roles Make Her Appearance A Huge Win\nThe Boys features numerous cameos and guest appearances throughout its first three seasons, but Swinton's might be the Amazon series' biggest one yet. While the likes of Simon Pegg, Paul Reiser, and Ann Cusack have all shown up throughout The Boys, many of the show's guest stars are best known for their television careers. They're still well-known actors, but they don't have the name recognition or movie career that Swinton does. The fact that Swinton is part of The Boys season 4's cast suggests that the series is looking for more high-profile talent.\nThis could continue into Gen V season 2 and The Boys season 5. In fact, it's likely more celebrities will want to be involved with the Amazon show as it continues to grow. Swinton's involvement is a big deal, as she's an Oscar-winning star with multiple large franchises under her belt. Considering Swinton's experience, it's probably no surprise that her performance as Ambrosius is impressive, even if it's limited to just a few scenes.\nDoes The Deep Really Love Ambrosius In The Boys Season 4?\nChace Crawford's Character Is Using The Octopus In Season 4\nPart of the reason Swinton's performance in The Boys season 4 is so devastating is that The Deep is stringing Ambrosius along despite not actually caring about her. The emotional impact gets lost in the absurdity of The Deep's relationships with sea creatures, but it's clear that Ambrosius truly cares for the Supe. The feeling doesn't appear to be mutual, as The Deep locks her in a closet and engages in sexual activities outside their \"relationship.\" He also lies to her repeatedly and ignores her pleas to spend time out of the closet.\nPart of the reason Swinton's performance in The Boys season 4 is so devastating is that The Deep is stringing Ambrosius along despite not actually caring about her.\nThe Deep is also putting her at risk by keeping her at Vought Tower, as Homelander doesn't want the octopus there. If he discovers The Deep is lying to him \u2014 or worse, finds the Supe in the midst of another scandal \u2014 he may retaliate against him and Ambrosius. Ambrosius doesn't deserve to be on the receiving end of Homelander's wrath, and if The Deep truly loved her, he'd set her free in The Boys season 4. Unfortunately, his character probably won't. He's already proven that he's a selfish person, and his actions don't suggest that will change any time soon.",

        "title": "Trevor Williams leads Nats in Battle of the Beltways",
        "article": "Williams leads Nats as they go over .500 for the first time since 2021\nWASHINGTON -- What a difference an offseason makes.\nThe season after allowing the most home runs among all National League pitchers, Trevor Williams is the only starter who has not surrendered a homer this year (35-inning minimum).\nThe right-hander extended his streak to seven homer-less starts in the Nationals\u2019 3-0 win over the Orioles on Tuesday at Nationals Park, putting Washington over .500 for the first time since July 2021.\n\u201cTo be over .500 for the first time since 2021 I think is a huge step forward for this team,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m part of it, I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m able to help and we\u2019re playing tremendous baseball right now.\u201d\nWilliams kept zeros on the board in that category with a career-high-tying eight strikeouts in five innings. He also allowed two hits and did not issue a walk across 77 pitches. His ERA dipped to 1.96 -- seventh among qualified NL pitchers -- compared to 5.55 last season.\nManager Dave Martinez credits Williams for working this winter on keeping the ball down, getting ahead in counts and mixing his pitches to maximize his fastball. The approach has worked -- Williams also is holding opponents\u2019 to a .248 slugging percentage, fourth-best among NL pitchers.\n\"The ability to change speeds and really live on the edges -- we just couldn\u2019t get anything going against him offensively,\u201d said Orioles manager Brandon Hyde. \u201cA crafty righty. He did a nice job. That fastball was 91 [mph], but it plays up because the other stuff is strikes, and he keeps the ball down really well.\"\nWilliams joins Gio Gonz\u00e1lez as the only pitcher in Nationals team history (2005-present) to not surrender a home run in seven starts. His 44 1/3-inning streak of homer-less games reaches back to Sept. 10, 2023, ninth-longest in Nats history, per Elias Sports Bureau.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got probably the best -- or if not, second or third -- offense in all of baseball,\u201d said Orioles starter Corbin Burnes. \u201cThese guys came across a guy today that had been throwing the ball well the last 40-something innings. When he\u2019s locating and mixing speeds and keeping guys off-balance, it\u2019s tough to hit.\"\nThe Nationals are managing Williams\u2019 innings and pitch count this season. As well as Williams was throwing, Martinez did not want to exceed 80 pitches. His outing concluded with an impressive leaping grab of a Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas lineout with an .870 expected batting average (xBA) by Luis Garc\u00eda Jr. at second base.\n\u201cIt was great,\u201d said Williams. \u201cHe\u2019s got great hops and he had great positioning, so it was perfect.\u201d\nWilliams has started in two of the Nationals\u2019 four shutouts this season, including a 1-0 win versus the Rangers in his last outing. On Tuesday, the Nationals provided a bigger offensive cushion. Joey Meneses put the Nats on the board with an RBI single to drive in Jesse Winker in the second inning. Washington added a pair of insurance runs in the seventh off RBI singles from Eddie Rosario and Trey Lipscomb.\nTuesday\u2019s victory was the Nats\u2019 first shutout against the Orioles since June 21, 2022. They already have surpassed last season\u2019s shutout total and tied the mark in 2022.\n\u201cThe starter stayed around the edges, he was getting a lot of calls around the edges, kind of kept us off-balance,\u201d said Orioles designated hitter Ryan O\u2019Hearn. \u201cOffensively, just one of those nights we couldn\u2019t get anything going.\u201d\nA nine-year veteran, Williams expects his opponents to strategize the next time they face him. Just as he prepared this offseason, he will continue to hone his approach to try to stay one step ahead and help grow the Nationals record.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had bulk starts now in the season, and now it\u2019s that time of the year where you have to see how teams will start adjusting, and it\u2019s time to adjust back,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s when pitching gets fun and that\u2019s when this part of the season gets fun. But I\u2019m just thankful that we\u2019re able to play really good baseball.\u201d",

        "article": "Nats Shutout O\u2019s in First Game of Battle of the Beltway Series, 3-0\nWASHINGTON, DC-The Battle of the Beltway series is always one to circle on the calendar. Many Nationals fans once rooted for the Orioles. Remember, DC did not have a pro baseball team for a period of 33 years. In the first series between the two teams this season, the O\u2019s met the Nats in DC. Nats starter Trevor Williams (4-0) was not intimidated by a heavy- hitting O\u2019s lineup featuring April\u2019s AL Player of the Month, shortstop Gunnar Henderson and the AL Player of the Week in catcher Adley Rustchman. The duo \u2013 who won Rookie of the Year honors in 2023 and 2022, respectively \u2013 batted one and two in the O\u2019s lineup. Williams, however, handled the lineup expertly.\nAfter giving up a hit in the first inning, he locked in, striking out eight in five innings on 77 pitches. He only allowed two hits the entire night and did not give any free passes, The defense played well behind him with second baseman Luis Garcia snagging a ball in mid-air to end the top of the fifth. The Nats have had trouble with errors this season, but with Williams on the mound, everyone playing behind him stepped up their effort.\nO\u2019s ace Corbin Burnes (3-2), who was acquired in an off-season trade from Milwaukee, allowed a hit in the first, and because of his slow delivery to the plate, had trouble with runners on base. He allowed three walks, and was called for a balk and disengagement violation. The Nats are known for their baserunning: They stole four total in the game and are tied with Cincinnati for the most in baseball at 57. A key steal came from Jesse Winker in the second. He stole second, and when Joey Meneses hit a single to left, he came around to score, giving the Nats a 1-0 lead.\nThe late innings came quickly. The first six took 90 minutes to complete. The Nats bullpen kept the pace Williams set. With Robert Garcia and Derek Law, six O\u2019s went up and went right back down.\nIn the bottom of the seventh, with Burnes still in, Meneses hit a double to left. Keibert Ruiz then moved him to third on a ball hit behind the runner. With Ruiz out, Eddie Rosario sent Meneses home. Up 2-0, the Nats scored another insurance run on the next at-bat. Trey Lipscomb singled to right, sending Rosario home and knocking Burnes out of the game.\nIn the top of the eighth, Hunter Harvey entered. Cedric Mullins provided a bit of tension with a single to right. But the Nats defense, again, came up big. In the bottom of the inning, with Jake Webb pitching for Baltimore, Nick Senzel took a walk. Next, Winker doubled off reliever Keegan Akin, sending Senzel to third. With two outs, Rosario walked and Lipscomb came to the plate with the bases loaded. Looking to put the game out of reach, he hit a groundout to second.\nIn the top of the ninth, Kyle Finnegan came in to nail down save no. 12 of his season. The O\u2019s frustration finally showed when Ryan O\u2019 Hearn and Manager Brandon Hyde were ejected for arguing a strikeout. To give the umpire credit, when a closer is going as good as Finnegan, it\u2019s hard not to call pitches in his favor. For a night, the Nats have bragging rights. Perhaps more significant, this scrappy team is one game over .500 for the first time in three years.\nClick HERE for full boxscore and highlights.",

        "title": "Orioles-Nationals series preview: The \u201cBeltway Rivalry\u201d returns - Camden Chat",
        "article": "Does the \u201cBattle of the Beltways\u201d move the needle for you? The Yankees still exist, so there\u2019s no need for artificial hatred in my opinion, but go ahead and get up for this one if you so choose.\nBaltimore\u2019s matchup against the Nationals should bring the usual MASN dispute stories, quips about Ripken jerseys in the back of the closet, and possibly some Jonathan Papelbon slander if anyone is feeling feisty. It will also bring a pair of top-tier pitching matchups.\nThe Nationals have surprised many by posting a .500 record through the first 34 games of the season. Bryce Harper and Juan Soto are long gone, but the Nationals are a scrappy bunch led by shortstop CJ Abrams, second baseman Luis Garc\u00eda and left fielder Jesse Winker.\nThe Nationals began the week tied with Cincinnati for the league lead in steals with 57. They rank in the bottom third of baseball in home runs (31), but the Nats fall in the middle of the pack for on-base percentage (.312) and runs scored (142).\nRegardless of whether the rivalry moves the needle, the Orioles want as many wins as possible. Washington may have entered the season with low expectations, but these games will not be gimmes for the Birds.\nGame 1: Tuesday, May 7, 6:45 pm, MASN/MASN 2\nRHP Corbin Burnes (3-1, 2.61 ERA) vs. RHP Trevor Williams (3-0, 2.27 ERA)\nThe Orioles will trot out their ace Corbin Burnes for the start of the series. Burnes took his first loss last week despite limiting New York to two runs over six innings. It feels like the Orioles should win every game that Burnes starts. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like having an ace on the team, and that\u2019s what it feels like when Burnes takes the mound for Baltimore.\nBurnes will square off against a resurgent Trevor Williams. The former Pirate struggled last year during his first season in Washington. Williams posted a 6-10 record and a 5.55 ERA over 144.1 innings. He\u2019s fared much better this season with a 2.27 ERA over six starts.\nWilliams led the NL with 34 home runs allowed last season, but he has yet to allow a long ball this year. Let\u2019s see what Gunnar and the boy have to say about that.\nWilliams busted out the magic act last week against the Rangers when he managed to escape two bases-loaded, no-out jams in the same game. The feat had not been accomplished since 2018.\nGame 2: Wednesday, May 8, 6:45 pm, MASN/MASN2\nRHP Kyle Bradish (0-0, 1.93 ERA) vs. LHP Mitchell Parker (2-1, 2.53 ERA)\nKyle Bradish held the Yankees to one run over 4.2 innings in his return last week. The 27-year-old looked healthy after striking out five, allowing four hits, and walking a pair. Bradish will look to work deeper into the game against Washington, but the bullpen should be ready after a day off yesterday and Burnes starting today.\nA healthy Bradish will provide a significant boost to an already impressive rotation. Bradish finished fourth in the AL Cy Young Award voting after a breakout 2023, and the Nationals hope to have found a breakout star in Mitchell Parker.\nD.C. selected Parker in the fifth round of the 2020 draft. The 24-year-old has only four major-league starts under his belt, but he\u2019s already bested the Dodgers and Astros. Parker took his first loss last week after allowing three runs in 5.1 innings against the Rangers.\nParker went seven strong against Houston, but he failed to complete six innings during his other three starts. Washington\u2019s bullpen holds a 3.81 ERA and 1.420 WHIP this season.\nPoll\nHow many games will the Orioles win during their mini-series against the Nationals?\nThis poll is closed\n-\n67%\n2 (Orioles sweep)\n-\n29%\n1\n-\n2%\n0 (Orioles get swept)",

        "article": "Trending\nFeil faces Beltway Capital\u2019s foreclosure on River North loft office\nNew York-based landlord will likely surrender 730 North Franklin to Maryland-based firm that bought $15.3M loan at a discount\nA few weeks after snagging a loan for one Chicago office and retail building, Jeffrey Feil is set to let another go back to its lender.\nHis New York-based firm Feil Organization owns a large portfolio of commercial real estate in Chicago, Florida and New York. It was hit this week with a $15.3 million foreclosure lawsuit over a debt gone wrong at 730 North Franklin Street.\nAt 92,000 square feet, it\u2019s a relatively small building for Feil \u2014 which also jointly owns a high-end retail and office building at 645 North Michigan Avenue that was just recapitalized with a $55 million loan. But it\u2019s another example of a big-time landlord caught up in financial distress as office tenants shift away from River North lofts and interest-rate surges squeeze borrowers.\nMaryland-based Beltway Capital in October bought the debt secured by the Franklin Street building at a significant discount from the $15.3 million that Feil borrowed, according to public records and a source familiar with the property. The loan was originated in 2017 by Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, which sold the debt to Beltway, according to Cook County records and the lawsuit Beltway filed in county court.\nIt\u2019s unclear how large of a discount on the debt Beltway notched when it took over the right to foreclose on the building.\nFeil declined to comment, and neither Beltway nor an attorney representing the firm returned requests for comment.\nBeltway alleged Feil missed the monthly payment on the loan due in November and didn\u2019t cure the default during a grace period that ended in December, the lawsuit shows. Feil took out the loan around the same time the landlord bought the building, in 2017, for $23.3 million.\nIt was more than 90 percent leased when Feil bought it, with satirical media outlet The Onion as the building\u2019s largest tenant. But the property\u2019s occupancy has dipped in recent years since the pandemic weighed on demand for loft-style offices.\nMany mid-size tenants have cut their real estate footprints to go to hybrid workplace models or fully remote. Tenants that remain in the market have increasingly flocked to new or recently remodeled downtown towers that offer the best amenities.\nFeil is unlikely to fight the foreclosure and will probably hand back the keys to Beltway, according to a person familiar with the property.\nThis isn\u2019t the only landlord to take a loss in River North\u2019s loft office scene in recent months. KBS Growth & Income REIT in December sold the seven-story building at 213 West Institute Place for $17 million, after paying $43.5 million to buy it in 2017.",

        "title": "Beltway Notes: Wood, Thomas, Wells, Webb - MLB Trade Rumors",
        "article": "One of the chief questions surrounding the Nationals this season is when star prospect James Wood could be making his Major League debut, though that debate might be put on hold while Wood overcomes a minor injury.\u00c2 Wood left Thursday\u2019s Triple-A game with tightness in his right hamstring, and Nats manager Davey Martinez told reporters (including Andrew Golden of the Washington Post) that the removal was precautionary in nature.\nWe could learn as early as today whether or not this injury is serious enough to merit a stint on the seven-day minor league IL, or if Wood could potentially be ready to go after another day or two of rest.\u00c2 Naturally the team is going to be as cautious as possible with Wood given that, if healthy, he seems to be forcing the issue of a call-up.\u00c2 Acquired from the Padres as part of the Juan Soto trade package in 2022, Wood was a consensus top-15 prospect in baseball even before he started obliterating Triple-A pitching.\u00c2 The 21-year-old is hitting .355/.465/.596 over 202 plate appearances with Triple-A Rochester, with nine homers and 10 steals (in 11 tries).\nMore from the Nationals and the Orioles\u2026\n- It has now been a month since a Grade 2 MCL sprain sent Lane Thomas to Washington\u2019s 10-day injured list, and Martinez told Golden and company that Thomas will be re-evaluated this weekend.\u00c2 This could potentially mean an activation from the IL, or perhaps just a move up to Triple-A games in the next stage of Thomas\u2019 rehab assignment.\u00c2 Thomas has already played in four games with Double-A Harrisburg, and Martinez said that Thomas has been a little sore but otherwise feeling okay in his return to action.\u00c2 Thomas was off to a slow start (.184/.250/.253) over his first 96 PA of the season, but the outfielder was the Nationals\u2019 most consistent hitter in 2023, with 28 homers and a .268/.315/.468 slash line over 682 PA.\n- The Orioles\u2019 pitching depth has again become a talking point with John Means and Dean Kremer both hitting the 15-day injured list in the last few days.\u00c2 Tyler Wells has been on the IL since mid-April due to elbow inflammation, and the righty will start playing catch this week, manager Brandon Hyde told reporters (including Matt Weyrich of the Baltimore Sun).\u00c2 This represents something of a restart of Wells\u2019 recovery program, as Wells was shut down with more soreness after attempting some catch at the start of May.\u00c2 Given the setback, it would appear as though Wells is still several weeks away from a return to the 26-man roster, as he\u2019ll need to ramp up before even starting a minor league rehab assignment.\u00c2 Wells has a solid 3.93 ERA over 222 1/3 innings for Baltimore over the last two seasons, working mostly as a starter though some struggles cost him his rotation spot last year.\n- Right-hander Nathan Webb will miss the rest of the 2024 season after undergoing left Achilles tendon surgery, as Webb himself announced on his Instagram page.\u00c2 Webb underwent Tommy John surgery in spring 2023 and was slated to return to the mound around midseason.\u00c2 \u201cI was only a few weeks away from getting into games after rehabbing\u2026.however, the good news is that I will make a full recovery and be 100 percent ready for Spring Training 2025,\u201d Webb wrote.\u00c2 The latest injury won\u2019t impact Webb\u2019s status with the Orioles, as the club signed him to a two-year minor league contract last October with the understanding that Webb would already be missing a big chunk of the 2024 campaign.\u00c2 The 26-year-old Webb has yet to make his MLB debut, and he has a 6.11 ERA over 268 minor league innings in the Royals\u2019 farm system.",

        "title": "Trevor Williams leads Nats in Battle of the Beltways",
        "article": "Williams leads Nats as they go over .500 for the first time since 2021\nWASHINGTON -- What a difference an offseason makes.\nThe season after allowing the most home runs among all National League pitchers, Trevor Williams is the only starter who has not surrendered a homer this year (35-inning minimum).\nThe right-hander extended his streak to seven homer-less starts in the Nationals\u2019 3-0 win over the Orioles on Tuesday at Nationals Park, putting Washington over .500 for the first time since July 2021.\n\u201cTo be over .500 for the first time since 2021 I think is a huge step forward for this team,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m part of it, I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019m able to help and we\u2019re playing tremendous baseball right now.\u201d\nWilliams kept zeros on the board in that category with a career-high-tying eight strikeouts in five innings. He also allowed two hits and did not issue a walk across 77 pitches. His ERA dipped to 1.96 -- seventh among qualified NL pitchers -- compared to 5.55 last season.\nManager Dave Martinez credits Williams for working this winter on keeping the ball down, getting ahead in counts and mixing his pitches to maximize his fastball. The approach has worked -- Williams also is holding opponents\u2019 to a .248 slugging percentage, fourth-best among NL pitchers.\n\"The ability to change speeds and really live on the edges -- we just couldn\u2019t get anything going against him offensively,\u201d said Orioles manager Brandon Hyde. \u201cA crafty righty. He did a nice job. That fastball was 91 [mph], but it plays up because the other stuff is strikes, and he keeps the ball down really well.\"\nWilliams joins Gio Gonz\u00e1lez as the only pitcher in Nationals team history (2005-present) to not surrender a home run in seven starts. His 44 1/3-inning streak of homer-less games reaches back to Sept. 10, 2023, ninth-longest in Nats history, per Elias Sports Bureau.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got probably the best -- or if not, second or third -- offense in all of baseball,\u201d said Orioles starter Corbin Burnes. \u201cThese guys came across a guy today that had been throwing the ball well the last 40-something innings. When he\u2019s locating and mixing speeds and keeping guys off-balance, it\u2019s tough to hit.\"\nThe Nationals are managing Williams\u2019 innings and pitch count this season. As well as Williams was throwing, Martinez did not want to exceed 80 pitches. His outing concluded with an impressive leaping grab of a Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas lineout with an .870 expected batting average (xBA) by Luis Garc\u00eda Jr. at second base.\n\u201cIt was great,\u201d said Williams. \u201cHe\u2019s got great hops and he had great positioning, so it was perfect.\u201d\nWilliams has started in two of the Nationals\u2019 four shutouts this season, including a 1-0 win versus the Rangers in his last outing. On Tuesday, the Nationals provided a bigger offensive cushion. Joey Meneses put the Nats on the board with an RBI single to drive in Jesse Winker in the second inning. Washington added a pair of insurance runs in the seventh off RBI singles from Eddie Rosario and Trey Lipscomb.\nTuesday\u2019s victory was the Nats\u2019 first shutout against the Orioles since June 21, 2022. They already have surpassed last season\u2019s shutout total and tied the mark in 2022.\n\u201cThe starter stayed around the edges, he was getting a lot of calls around the edges, kind of kept us off-balance,\u201d said Orioles designated hitter Ryan O\u2019Hearn. \u201cOffensively, just one of those nights we couldn\u2019t get anything going.\u201d\nA nine-year veteran, Williams expects his opponents to strategize the next time they face him. Just as he prepared this offseason, he will continue to hone his approach to try to stay one step ahead and help grow the Nationals record.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had bulk starts now in the season, and now it\u2019s that time of the year where you have to see how teams will start adjusting, and it\u2019s time to adjust back,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s when pitching gets fun and that\u2019s when this part of the season gets fun. But I\u2019m just thankful that we\u2019re able to play really good baseball.\u201d",

        "title": "'Big Johnny' Is Not One of the 38 People Being Considered for Greg Landsman's Cincinnati City Council Seat",
        "article": "A little over three dozen people are officially in the running for a soon-to-be-vacant seat on Cincinnati City Council.\nWith Cincinnati City Council member Greg Landsman preparing to head to the U.S. House of Representatives in January, the city is making plans to appoint his local successor. Landsman has designated council member Reggie Harris as the person who will appoint the person who will take his seat.\nApplications for the position opened Nov. 22 on the city government's website and closed at 11:59 p.m. Nov. 27. Gus Ricksecker, Harris' chief of staff, tells CityBeat that there were 49 total applicants, with 38 of those completing all requirements and being fully considered. Seven people did not submit full applications, one was a test application and one \u2013 \"Big Johnny\" \u2013 was tossed for being a joke. See all applicants at the bottom of this story.\nDuring the application period, the city also posted a survey for Cincinnati residents to share what they were looking for in a new council member.\n\"We sent out a community survey last week, and the responses were overwhelmingly in favor of (1)Prior Involvement in the Community (2) Ability to work with others and (3) Progressive values (all of which around 75% of the 130+ respondents),\" Ricksecker says. \"These will likely, in tandem with the feedback we get from other council members and interviews, will make a smaller group of candidates stand out.\"\nRicksecker says that Harris will present the list of 38 viable applicants during the council\u2019s Nov. 29 public safety and governance committee meeting, soliciting feedback from the council about the qualities Landsman's successor should have. Ricksecker adds that later this week, Harris expects to share a narrowed list of candidates to be interviewed.\nDuring the Nov. 22 address with Landsman, Harris noted that he would announce who he would appoint as the new council member during the week of Dec. 5.\n\u201cThis is not going to be a popularity contest. The appointment process is a process of continuity. It\u2019s about thinking about what we\u2019ve established over this year and what we\u2019ll do going into the next year,\u201d Harris said then. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also about choosing someone who has the ability to articulate a clear plan for advancing this council\u2019s priorities: core services, public safety, housing, equity, pedestrian safety and sustainability.\u201d\nGenerally, Cincinnati\u2019s municipal code says that a designee on Cincinnati City Council must appoint a successor to a vacant seat within 60 days. If the vacancy is not filled, the city\u2019s mayor may appoint someone to the post. A chosen successor would serve as a council member until the end of the predecessor\u2019s original term, when they can choose to run for election to retain their seat.\nLandsman won his Cincinnati City Council seat in 2017 and assumed office Jan. 2, 2018. He was reelected in 2021 with a term expiring at the end of 2023. On Nov. 8, Landsman defeated incumbent Steve Chabot in a general election and will represent the 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives in January. During his campaign, Landsman highlighted restoring abortion rights, repairing infrastructure like the Brent Spence Bridge and passing LGBTQIA+ protections as his priorities in Congress. His time on the council largely has focused on general safety, violence reduction, reproductive rights and neighborhood beautification, among other issues.\nOn Nov. 22, Landsman said that because he will be sworn in as a congressman on Jan. 3, he plans to formally resign his Cincinnati City Council position on Jan. 2. His successor then would take the city\u2019s oath of office that morning.\nThese 38 candidates are being considered for Landsman's Cincinnati City Council seat:\n- Bill Froehle (withdrawn)\n- Caleb Price\n- Antonio M. Sanders Jr.\n- Adam Koehler\n- Ryan Mahoney\n- Dadrien Washington\n- Quinten Taylor\n- Dean Kaplan\n- Scott Hand\n- Victor Phillips\n- Gavi Begtrup\n- Galen Gordon\n- Gerald Checco\n- Jaime Castle\n- Dale Mallory\n- William Fleaher\n- Jenelle M.

        "title": "Driving Change: The Future of Cincinnati Metro - Cincinnati Magazine",
        "article": "Outside the Vineyard Church\u2019s Healing Center in Springdale, three freshly decaled 20-foot Ram transit vans gleam in the sun. Members of the community, media, politicians, and Cincinnati Metro staff gather round for a ribbon cutting and photo op to inaugurate MetroNow!, a fleet that will eventually grow to about 50 on-demandvehicles serving six zones around Hamilton County.\nLike an Uber or a Lyft, MetroNow! is summoned via smart phone (or dispatcher if you\u2019d like to go old school). For $2 a ride, the van arrives and carries you to your destination if it\u2019s local or, if you have farther to go, connects you to Metro\u2019s bus network.\nMetro CEO Darryl Haley steps to the mic. \u201cPublic transportation is the great equalizer,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will use public transportation to drive equity in our region. When we envisioned what MetroNow! could look like, we looked at communities where our service was not as robust.\u201d\nThey thought of young families and the elderly, he says, as well as job seekers who can\u2019t afford to drive or to take a ride-share service. \u201cNow, if you live, work, or play in Sharonville, Northgate, Mt. Healthy, Forest Park, Springfield Township, Glendale, Woodlawn, Colerain Township, or North College Hill, you\u2019ll be among the first to be able to seamlessly utilize MetroNow! service.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d says the woman standing next to me. \u201cFinally!\u201d\nMetroNow! is just the beginning of what Cincinnati Metro, which turns 50 this year, is rolling out across the county thanks to passage of Issue 7 in 2020. The new countywide sales tax increase funds SORTA, Metro\u2019s parent agency, for 25 years and supports an ambitious vision, Reinventing Metro, that hopes to spur community change beyond just improving bus service.\nEven if you aren\u2019t a bus rider, you can expect to feel the effects of what Haley and his team imagine for our region\u2019s roads over the next two decades.\nIn 1972, in the midst of a global oil crisis, Cincinnati residents approved an earnings tax to fund the foundering Cincinnati Transportation Inc., a private bus company created from the city\u2019s previous streetcar lines. The following year, the freshly minted Southwest Ohio Transit Authority (SORTA) took over Cincinnati\u2019s bus service, and \u201cQueen City Metro\u201d was born. The acquisition immediately lowered fares, which had been some of the highest in the nation, to 25 cents a ride.\nFor most of its five decades in operation, the city earnings tax remained the agency\u2019s main source of funding. It wasn\u2019t enough. Several attempts to remedy a perpetual funding shortage failed, the most recent being the 2002 Metro Moves plan, which sought to beef up funding, improve bus service, and add light rail to meet a growing region\u2019s needs.\nIn March 2020, in an election where turnout was hampered by the COVID pandemic, Hamilton County voters approved Issue 7 by a narrow margin. The levy replaces the portion of the city earnings tax that funds SORTA, which oversees Metro and countywide paratransit services, with a 0.8 percent sales tax increase. Three-quarters of the money collected each year goes to improving Metro bus services, while 25 percent goes to a transit infrastructure fund (TIF) that directs money to improving roads, sidewalks, bridges, crosswalks, and other projects falling within three quarters of a mile of a bus route. That includes the Western Hills Viaduct, which received $205 million from the fund in 2021. Fiscal conservatives who balked at previous transit levies liked that Issue 7 reduced the city earnings tax.\nHaley joined Metro in 2006 after returning to the region to help family following the death of his father. After stints as executive vice president and chief operating officer, he was named CEO and general manager in November 2019. He says the difference transit can make in a person\u2019s life is personal\u2014while a student at Withrow High School, he rode the bus every day to his first job, a role that led to a 28-year career in the healthcare supply sector. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had that job if I didn\u2019t have the ability to catch the bus,\u201d he says, recalling that the experience instilled a strong sense of how public transit drives equity.\n\u201cBut even though the country had changed and our region had changed since 1972, Metro was still on the same funding system,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a fight to keep as much service as we could. Every time you cut service, someone doesn\u2019t have a connection, and that changes the fabric of the region.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a quandary faced by transit agencies nationwide. Success relies on ridership. But when falling ridership leads to further funding cuts, cities are forced to cut service, and even more riders flee to other modes of transportation. This death spiral was all the more pronounced for Metro given its limited funding model.\nWhen he took over as CEO, Haley knew another voter referendum loomed. So he refused to cut service, even when that decision came at the cost, he says, of deferring garage maintenance and technology upgrades.\nSORTA convened a working group in 2018 to study the need for new funding and better service. Grassroots organizations including the Better Bus Coalition joined city and business leaders to call for a new funding mechanism. They worked with the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana Regional Council of Governments (OKI) to determine travel patterns, Haley says, and see where people were living and where they worked. \u201cWe spent a lot of time, and I mean a lot of time, talking to the community, the business community, and elected officials and asking, How do you connect this region in a real way,\u201d he says. \u201cAs we were fighting to get through this, we came up with Reinventing Metro.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a unifying message behind the plan, Haley says, \u201ceven for those who don\u2019t ride the bus. Even those we never expect to ride. It\u2019s this: The people you depend on depend on transit.\u201d\nHaley depends on Khaled Shammout to lead the day-to-day work of analyzing and upgrading a bus system that serves a 400-square-mile region that\u2019s home to more than 2 million people and is growing. As Metro\u2019s chief strategic officer, he scrutinizes data gleaned from on-board GIS sensors and pores through community feedback to find efficiencies that will improve service. Sprawling organizational charts cover his office walls.\nShammout\u2019s 28-year career in transit began with an internship at the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) in Columbus. From there he went to leadership roles in Palm Beach and Jacksonville, Florida, as well as Makkah (Mecca), Saudi Arabia, before joining Metro in 2018. He\u2019s an avid reader and author. His 2021 book, The Implosion of Public Transit and the Case for an Infinite Game, outlines transit\u2019s existential crisis and offers a path through survival to thriving. His book applies scholar James Carse\u2019s concept of the \u201cinfinite game,\u201d adopting long-term strategies based not on finite targets but on a continuum of improvement.\nIn a landscape where transit competes with a plethora of options for getting around, Shammout says, transit agencies must adapt or die. His work is complicated\u2014tiny tweaks can make a big difference for both Metro drivers and riders, impacting efficiency across the system.\n\u201cIn transit, certain fundamentals apply,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more frequency we have, the more ridership we gain. If you have buses running just once an hour, people are not going to wait an hour to catch a trip, right? If buses are running every 15 minutes, that\u2019s an incentive for people to ride. Likewise, if the bus doesn\u2019t go where you need it to when you need it, you aren\u2019t going to take it.\u201d\nSo Metro has created new bus routes, including cross-town routes outside of the old downtown-centric hub-and-spoke map; built a new transit hub in Northside; increased frequency on 10 routes; and added Sunday service to some routes. And in a first for Cincinnati, says Shammout, seven routes were converted to run 24-hour service\u2014important for areas where he identified high concentrations of third-shift jobs. He says that those routes, as well as those with increased frequency, have shown significant increases in ridership.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Metro was back to 80 percent of pre-pandemic ridership. Ridership on routes with upgraded service saw increases as high as 200 percent.\n\u201cSo to put it in context, the rest of the country is somewhere between 65 and 70 percent of pre-pandemic ridership,\u201d says Haley. \u201cThese numbers are showing that we built it, and they\u2019re coming. They\u2019re returning and riding.\u201d\nThis summer\u2019s rollout of MetroNow! service marks a significant turning point. It manifests the expansion of Metro\u2019s geographic footprint across Hamilton County, making new service available to suburban residents who can\u2019t easily reach fixed bus routes.\nThe next big step is bus rapid transit (BRT), which creates high-speed bus service corridors akin to light rail. Metro is planning to complete the first two corridors by 2027. BRT has worked well for other Midwestern cities, both moving people quickly and attracting billions in real estate and economic investment dollars.\nBRT will tie together communities across the region by deploying larger, often articulated buses that support level boarding with elevated platforms providing a light-rail-like service, moving along major street corridors that are a hybrid of bus-only and in-traffic lanes. BRT buses will also get signal priority to move ahead of traffic at intersections. They\u2019ll arrive every 15 minutes or less, so frequent you won\u2019t even need to consult a schedule, says Shammout, who senses that BRT will impact how county residents move and, by making corridors attractive to developers, where they choose to live.\nIn recent decades, the American transit landscape has seen an explosion of new options. Think of the rise of Uber and Lyft, the availability of rentable electric scooters and bikes, and on-demand \u201cmicro-transit\u201d options like MetroNow! vans. Even that old workhorse, the bus, has been transformed. With free WiFi and charging ports, real-time arrival information, and a smoother ride, says Haley, \u201cThis is not your father\u2019s bus.\u201d\nAll of the options compete for attention at a rare inflection point when more and more people are suddenly open to changing their relationships with cars.\nYounger Americans are reconsidering the necessity of car ownership, driven by economic realities, concern for the environment, and other factors. Some families are buying a bus pass instead of shelling out for a second car. In 2022, according to the American Automobile Association, car ownership cost the average American $10,728 a year. That\u2019s about $900 a month on your vehicle at a time when gas, food, and housing aren\u2019t exactly cheap.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t unusual to find riders who may use Uber to get to a light rail station that will take them to work, and then on the way home take a bus to meet friends at a restaurant and a bike-share or scooter-share for the final leg of their trip,\u201d says American Public Transportation Association CEO Paul Skoutelas when I reach out to get a sense of how Metro\u2019s upgrades fit into the national landscape.\n\u201cThe trend in public transportation is to offer riders more options\u2014in terms of different modes, times, accessibility, fares\u2014and then to connect those options physically and digitally.\u201d\nAmericans have come to expect customized services, picking and choosing from a wide spectrum of options based on their needs, their lifestyles, and their budgets. When it comes to transit, then, \u201ccities with the most options are likely to thrive,\u201d says Skoutelas.\nMetro\u2019s BRT project aims to link as many transportation modes as possible, from park-to-ride locations at the end of each BRT corridor to level boarding from platforms to make buses more wheelchair-, bike-, and scooter-friendly. And stops are designed to align with other transit options.\nAt a projected cost of $300 million, Cincinnati\u2019s first two BRT corridors will roll out along Reading Road and Hamilton Avenue, with Montgomery Road and Glenway Avenue receiving improvements during that construction phase in anticipation of their conversion to BRT down the line.\nGus Ricksecker, 26, is a member of the generation that no longer sees car ownership as essential. He commutes by bus to his job at City Hall, where he\u2019s chief of staff for Councilmember Reggie Harris, who was a big Issue 7 proponent. Ricksecker takes the bus for most errands and entertainment, including some of those new late-night buses\u2014which he says are often packed. He\u2019s saving money for a condo down payment, perhaps in a building along one of the BRT corridors.\n\u201cA very tangible impact of passing Issue 7 is that BRT can fundamentally change the future growth of the city in terms of where dense new housing is built,\u201d says Ricksecker. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of zoning reform, and there\u2019s more talk about zoning and land use reform here. And at the center of that conversation is bus rapid transit.\u201d\nAs affordable housing advocates and city officials haggle over how to build more housing options, the creation of robust BRT corridors literally lays a path forward. More mobility means more freedom in terms of where we live, allowing more residents to live in affordable areas and driving what urban planners call \u201ctransit-oriented development.\u201d\n\u201cApartment buildings are going up around the city, but in locations that aren\u2019t necessarily intentional,\u201d says Ricksecker. \u201cIt\u2019s just wherever developers can grab land, essentially. But if we start building more apartments in major transit corridors, we\u2019ll get more transit users and get more people out of their cars.\u201d\nIn other cities that introduced BRT, transit-oriented development sprung up along the corridors and property values close to the routes rose. Cleveland\u2019s $200 million Healthline BRT generated about $9.5 billion in development, for instance. An Ohio State University study of how BRT impacts property values in 10 U.S. cities found that multi-family residences along the corridors saw a 41.5 percent increase in property value.\nMeanwhile, a 2018 UC Economics Center study estimated Reinventing Metro should create close to 20,000 more jobs and make 740 more employers accessible by Metro. The new 24-hour service will reach more than half of Hamilton County jobs, or 10,000 employers. The same study estimates that increasing employers\u2019 access to a larger workforce could save businesses between $20 million and $30 million by reducing turnover.\nWhile Reinventing Metro should generate economic benefits throughout the region, environmental and societal benefits aren\u2019t as easy to quantify. More people on public transit means less traffic congestion, which means less pollution, energy usage, and carbon emissions. Nationally, U.S. mass transit saves 4.2 billion gallons of gasoline per year.\nSustainability in the face of climate change matters to young Americans. Metro does everything from washing buses with rainwater to operating hybrid buses, with plans this year to use federal funds to purchase 11 fully electric buses. BRT will use zero-emission vehicles.\nIn many ways, transit-oriented development can lead to greener neighborhoods and business districts. It allows parking minimum requirement codes to be reformed, rendering them outdated in settings where you don\u2019t necessarily need a car. Less parking makes neighborhoods cleaner, cooler, and more resilient to climate change. Many Cincinnati neighborhoods have begun to remove parking minimums, a step in the right direction given that there are approximately 2 billion parking spaces in the U.S.\u2014between four and eight spaces per car, by some estimates.\nPublic transit is 10 times safer than driving, says Skoutelas of the American Public Transportation Association, and makes streets safer for drivers by reducing the total number of cars on the road. Transit users are healthier because they\u2019re also pedestrians getting in their daily steps.\nMore jobs, additional dollars in our pockets, and a greener, more pleasant city\u2014improved public transit seems to be a panacea. How about the less quantifiable yet no less important benefits that reliable, accessible transit offers on a societal level? Consider the interactions that happen in denser neighborhoods or on a shared transit system, where we aren\u2019t walled off behind the wheel of a car. Isn\u2019t there value in living face to face, especially at a time when intolerance seems to be on the rise?\nRobert Putnam decries the erosion of American civic life and relationships in his book Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. It\u2019s partly due, he says, to suburbanization and the rise of the single-occupancy car commuter. \u201cSpatial fragmentation between the home and the workplace is bad for community,\u201d he writes.\nMore reliable and frequent bus service probably isn\u2019t the go-to solution for society\u2019s ills, but it can better connect the home and the workplace for many citizens. And that\u2019s a start, isn\u2019t it? \u201cThe transit network we\u2019re building today will determine what happens next,\u201d says Haley. \u201cOnce we build BRT and people see how quickly they can move through corridors, maybe the conversation changes. As we build this robust transit system and people decide, I don\u2019t need a car, I\u2019ve got a connection, then we really start thinking differently about the future.\u201d",

My father takes the bus or rides his bike to work every single day. He's going to sell that car once I get into college. I've got a COTA pass and use it a lot. I've used the pass to go to Ohio State for some of my classes. Then I go from OSU to Centennial. One of the classes I took was city and regional planning, and we looked at neighborhoods and cities from each end of the spectrum. You live in Portland, and you can go your entire life without a car. But if you live in Dublin, you can't go without a car.\nQ: Why Centennial?\nA: My dad was committed that I was going to Columbus City Schools. My sister (Molly) went to Columbus Metro on Kenny Road, where you basically go to OSU all of the time. Centennial is the most complete city school in Columbus in that it has all the course work. I've been more than pleased at Centennial.\nQ: What courses have you taken at Ohio State?\nA: My first semester junior year, I took psychology and city and regional planning. I took anthropology the third semester. I recently took introduction to U.S. intelligence.\nQ: You are going to blend right in at UC, right?\nA: I've also taken seven AP classes at Centennial, and I think I won't have to take remedial anything in college.\nQ: Where did your pursuit of excellence in the classroom begin?\nA: My parents (his mother is Missy) sent me to a French emergence school from kindergarten to third grade. Then I was transferred to an eclipse program at Hubbard. Everyone was striving academically. Everyone pushed each other so hard, to the point where we thought anything less than an \"A\" was failure.\nQ: What are you involved in at school?\nA: I'm a student ambassador with Lake Wilburn for Centennial. This year, we worked on projects to promote Columbus City Schools. For instance, a lot of parents in my neighborhood have to make decisions about where to enroll their kids. Some move to Dublin. We try to show the benefits of our school system. We want to help improve the image of Columbus City Schools by showing them that their kids can go to school and thrive. We've met with (superintendent Dan) Good several times about improving the image of the school system. We went to a couple of events, such as the state of the district meeting. Lake and I had a video project where we'd film football games and the theater as a promotion for our school.\nQ: Was choosing Cincinnati a difficult decision?\nA: All the schools I applied to are in major cities. It came down to NYU and Cincinnati. My dad told me to go where my heart is. In the end, it would have cost a lot to go to NYU. That's $72,000 a year; I was offered $33,000 in scholarship money. My dad said he could (help) me, but in the end I didn't think all that student debt was worth it. I got into Cincinnati's honors program. \u2026 I'll be more than happy there. I'm getting between $4,000 and $5,000 a year.\nQ: What is your class rank?\nA: I'm No. 2 (frowning). But there isn't just one valedictorian. I'm going to audition for class speaker for graduation. I'm going to get a four-year achievement award. I received an OCEA award for athletic and academic achievement. I am recognized here.\nQ: So you are a good sport?\nA: I'm a baseball captain and try to be a pick-me-up. I'm the first in line to shake the hands of opposing coaches and players.\nmznidar@dispatch.com\n@MarkZnidar",

        "title": "Cincinnati Photographer Romain Mayambi Captures the Beauty of Movement in Unconventional Places",
        "article": "This story is featured in CityBeat's March 6 print edition.\nIt\u2019s late January at a coffee shop in Clifton, and I\u2019m waiting for Romain Mayambi. The Cincinnati-based photographer, originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is on his way to becoming a self-taught great, and has agreed to tell me his story. I pull up his website again while I wait.\nAs a gray dusk falls outside, I scroll through a warm and bright assembly of portraits, athletes and funky editorial. I am one of tens of thousands following Mayambi\u2019s colorful, high-energy work via Instagram. His visual storytelling has captured everything from street-style fashion to athletes in action. What started as a random hobby has turned into a skilled art form, connecting people, places and communities frame by frame.\nMayambi walks in right on time, wearing a bomber jacket and a friendly smile. He\u2019s just come from editing the latest in his series of \u201cathletes in unconventional spaces.\u201d Mayambi works as a risk analyst full time, so photography is like a second job. But he doesn\u2019t seem tired. He\u2019s as bright and energetic as his photos. We find a table and take a seat.\nMaybe it was fate\nMayambi has been taking photographs since he was a freshman in college studying finance at the University of Cincinnati. He\u2019s curious and observant. That, combined with his love of fashion, made him an avid people watcher and a natural behind the lens.\n\u201cI wanted to be able to capture those moments and those people,\u201d Mayambi says. So he picked up a camera. \u201cIt honestly just sparked out of nowhere.\u201d\nThe way Mayambi tells it, becoming a photographer was borderline fate, the trajectory of which began when he was 14. Mayambi\u2019s family wanted to move from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the U.S. They had no specific destination in mind, but a family friend suggested Cincinnati.\n\u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s kind of random. Like, Cincinnati of all places?\u201d Mayambi says. \u201cEverything happens for a reason. We were meant to come to Cincinnati and put our roots here.\u201d\nA few weeks after their move, Mayambi\u2019s mother enrolled him and his siblings at Aiken High School. The staff and the students made the transition easy. He felt welcome at his new school, comfortable even. He made friends and found a community. Mayambi attributes some of his sense of home here to the way he was treated in high school. Without that experience, maybe it would have been harder to find the confidence to pick up a camera.\n\u201cDo you ever have moments where you try to imagine what things would be like if they went differently?\u201d Mayambi asks. \u201cLike, if we moved to California or something, maybe I wouldn't have done photography.\u201d\nHis first subjects were fellow UC students, whose personal style caught his eye and imagination. Mayambi \u2014 who is very well dressed \u2014 had an eye for fashion even as a freshman, and decided to photograph the people around him.\n\u201cAt first I was about to start walking up to them with my iPhone,\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut my friends are like, \u2018that\u2019s kind of weird.\u2019\u201d\nDetermined to take the more professional approach, Mayambi borrowed a camera from his brother and started shooting. He learned to approach strangers and initiate conversations out of nowhere. He prioritized comfort and professionalism.\n\u201cThrough that I was able to meet super cool people who are friends with me to this day,\u201d Mayambi says.\nMayambi didn\u2019t have mentors or teachers to show him the ropes. He learned through experimentation and YouTube videos. Being self-taught in this way allowed him to develop a unique style from the ground up. Certain elements of the art were more intimidating than others \u2014 like lighting, which he put off learning for the first few years. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where to start,\u201d he says. But the interest always overcame the intimidation.\n\u201cWhen I love something I kind of get obsessed,\u201d Mayambi says. \u201cThat's all I'll do. I'll just be in my room watching YouTube videos about lighting.\u201d\nIt\u2019s all about the people\nCommunity is key to how Mayambi approaches his photography. Many shoots are a collaborative effort, with friends assisting and models sharing ideas throughout the process. His series \u201cYour Flower\u201d highlights people in the city who are actively creating community spaces, events and opportunities to connect. Mayambi gives each person flowers, takes their portrait and asks them questions about community, collaboration and art. The project is part showcase, part gratitude.\n\u201cI feel like we have a lot of amazing people in this city who make these moves,\u201d Mayambi says. \u201cI want to show appreciation.\u201d\nMayambi is a very affable person, easy to talk to and be around. That comes through in his photographs. Subjects seem at ease and fully present, almost certainly as a result of Mayambi\u2019s genuine, friendly demeanor. Each model\u2019s personality shines through the picture, making for photographs that feel alive and distinctive.\nCuriosity also plays a part. Mayambi has a practice of incorporating interviews into his projects, as with the \u201cYour Flower\u201d series. For another series, he\u2019s talking to photographers across the U.S., \u201cdiving deep into what it\u2019s like being a photographer.\u201d This video project is meant to dig into the nitty gritty of life behind the camera, to fill in the information that was missing when he started. There are plenty of videos that recommend cameras or talk about lighting rigs. But when it comes to understanding what it means to people to work in photography, and what it takes to stick with it, Mayambi says there\u2019s not a lot of content.\nNow that his audience is growing and he\u2019s becoming more established, Mayambi often gets messages from people asking how and where to start as a photographer. He hopes that these videos will become a resource to share. And he wants to know the answers, too.\n\u201cI'm doing it for myself as well, because I'm curious,\u201d he says. \u201cI'm always fascinated by the mind when it comes to creativity.\u201d\nMayambi continues to connect with other artists and collaborators across the country. It seems like his current trajectory could take him to other cities with bigger populations and more opportunities. But a move like that is not on his radar. Instead, much like the subjects of his \u201cYour Flowers\u201d series, Mayambi is committed to putting Cincinnati on the map as a hub of arts and culture.\n\u201cThis is my home. This is my favorite place to be,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve learned everything that I know now from here.\u201d\nAthletes anywhere and everywhere\nLast year, Mayambi shared what would become the first photos in an ongoing series of athletes performing in unexpected places. Two jiu-jitsu fighters stand poised on a red mat in the middle of an empty baseball field. Their movements are mirrored by their shadows. Clouds of the freshly tilled dirt rise from their bare feet. A bright white sun hovers above as one flips the other over his shoulder.\nA few weeks later, Mayambi shared part two: boxers in front of Union Terminal. Instead of fighting in a ring (where one might argue they belong), the men face off on bright green grass with Cincinnati\u2019s historic landmark as their backdrop.\nThe series continues to unfold, gaining more traction and attention with every new installment. A football player prepares to throw the ball down a lane at Madison Bowl. Track athletes sprint through Household Books. Two masked figures fence in Clifton Market. Each photograph celebrates athletic prowess and strong bodies in their element but out of place.\nAt the same time, the series reads as a subtle homage to the city that Mayambi calls home. Half of these locations are familiar places, buildings and overpasses one drives by regularly. These are the spots that catch Mayambi\u2019s eye as he goes about his life in Southwest Ohio.\nIn fact, the entire series started because of a particularly stunning baseball field. Mayambi and his dad were on their way to visit his older brother in Dayton.\n\u201c[I was] just sitting by the window, just staring outside, and I saw this dirt that was perfectly tilled,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like, oh my god. That dirt looks so pretty!\u201d\nHe was drawn to the setting before the rest of the idea fell into place. Mayambi started thinking about what he would do with a field like that if he used it in a shoot. His vision? Two fighters going at it.\n\u201cI thought about like, who do I want the fighters to be?\u201d he says. \u201cAnd for some reason I'm like, oh, jiu-jitsu fighters would be perfect.\u201d\nHe immediately posted a call for jiu-jitsu fighters on Instagram. A friend connected him to their brother, a jiu-jitsu fighter, who had another friend that was into the idea too.\nThe day after Mayambi found his fighters, he was driving home and felt that familiar tug of fate again.\n\u201cGuess what I saw,\u201d he says, wide eyed. \u201cA baseball field with tilled dirt, like literally right next to my house. Immediately I was like ok, found a spot.\u201d\nMayambi does not have a master plan for the athletes series, but he does have a running list of great ideas. Sometimes a location just speaks to him, and he mulls it over until he can decide which athlete would work best there. He also keeps notes on all the different types of athletes he\u2019d like to shoot. And athletes reach out to him, too. He\u2019s even had Olympians show interest, although distance and budget prevent him from taking up certain collaborations.\nMayambi himself is not much of an athlete. (When I ask, he laughs and says \u201cI\u2019ve been busted!\u201d) This opens the door for deeper collaboration. The athletes in his series know their bodies and their sport, so they can contribute ideas that Mayambi may not anticipate.\n\u201cIt feels like a collective project,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a 50/50 thing. I\u2019m like, \u2018I'll leave the technical to you guys, and I will capture you guys.\u2019\u201d\nPerhaps this collaborative spirit is part of what inspires the remarkable dedication in each athlete at the shoots. Mayambi says they all show up determined to get it right, and they maintain that spirit even when their photoshoot lasts for an hour and a half in the sun.\nPositive feedback and enthusiastic support continue to pour in for this series. The athletes, Mayambi\u2019s community of followers, and even random onlookers all seem invested in the project, interested to see where it will go next. By connecting photography, athletic performance, familiar landmarks, and public spaces, Mayambi maintains that thread of curiosity and community that runs through most of his work.\n\u201cPeople are sitting there watching it, enjoying it,\u201d he says of passers-by. \u201cAnd people feel a part of it.\u201d\nAnd again, Mayambi himself gets to satiate curiosity. His life as an artist and a risk analyst doesn\u2019t have him crossing paths with athletes out in the wild. Through this series, he gets to learn something new.\n\u201cIt's a different world for me,\u201d he says. \u201cDoing this project allows me to bring it into my world and also get into their world.\u201d\nWhen Mayambi first laid eyes on that neatly groomed baseball field, he didn\u2019t have a story in mind to tell. But as the series continues to grow into itself, something coherent is starting to unfold. It\u2019s a commentary on belonging, and how societal expectations can hinder a person\u2019s ability to feel at home somewhere.\n\u201cIt just ties back to kind of like the way life is set up,\u201d Mayambi says. \u201cLike these certain expectations in people\u2019s lives. Like \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t belong in these places. Only people who look like this belong here.\u2019\u201d\nBy placing divers in lecture halls and wrestlers on rooftops, Mayambi isn\u2019t just creating engaging art. He\u2019s rewriting the rules.\n\u201cI can place these athletes in these spaces even though they don\u2019t belong there,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like it translates really well with that story where it\u2019s like, we can do whatever we want.\u201d\nAs of now, there\u2019s no clear end game to the athletes series. The ideas are too plentiful, and Mayambi is following the momentum. Eventually he plans to showcase the series in an exhibition, and possibly a book. But for now, he says, \u201cI\u2019m kind of just going with the flow.\u201d\nFollow Romain Mayambi\u2019s work on Instagram at @romainmaya.",

        "article": "Meet the 30 Under 30 Local Cincinnati Class of 2024\nBy Alexandra York, Zoya Hasan and Alicia Park\nBig things are brewing in Cincinnati. From record-breaking NFL quarterback Joe Burrow to a 28-year-old founder of a multi-million dollar mental health startup, the Queen City is becoming a hot bed for young talent.\nMore than a decade ago, Forbes launched the 30 Under 30 franchise\u2014the definitive list spotlighting the must-know young people changing the world. Now, we\u2019re taking it local. The end result: The 30 pioneers charting Cincinnati\u2019s future.\nCaden Adams & Kayla Braden\n24, 24 | Cofounders, Peachy and Vintage\nAs sophomores at Northern Kentucky University, Kayla Braden and Caden Adams began selling thrifted goods on e-commerce platform Depop and became \u201ctop sellers\u201d on the app. The success encouraged them to expand their brand to a brick-and-mortar storefront their senior year. After quickly outgrowing that first space, they moved to the 2,500 square foot shop in the Greater Cincinnati area where their company, Peachy and Vintage, currently operates. The duo placed second in the KY Pitch competition in 2022 and were recognized as Cincy Inno 5 Under 25 winners in 2023.\nEmil Barr\n21 | Founder, Step Up Social\nLike many startups, Step Up Social was founded in Emil Barr\u2019s college dorm room in 2021. The marketing agency\u2014which specializes in short-form videos for TikTok and Instagram Reels\u2014brought in $550,000 in 2023 revenue and projects doubling that in 2024. Clients include Hulk Hogan, P&G and Decker's Brands. In July, Step Up Social merged with Los Angeles-based Candid Network, which counts clients like Shopify, Nike and Banana Republic. Barr is also the founded Flashpass, a social media certification company that provides social media training for businesses through Ohio\u2019s TechCred program. Barr says Flashpass\u2019s revenue is on track to hit sales of around $900,000 this year.\nEliana Batsakis\n26 | Founder, Eliana Batsakis\nEliana Batsakis is a designer, artist and founder of her eponymous fashion brand, Eliana Batsakis. The 26-year-old has been recognized by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and was featured in their 2021 Fashion Future Graduate Showcase. Her work made its television debut in Season 2 of Netflix\u2019s Next in Fashion, a design competition show co-hosted by industry vets Tan France and Gigi Hadid. Batsakis also creates custom clothing for celebrity clients like singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen and the Cincinnati Opera. This September, she takes on a new role as the head costume designer for the Cincinnati's Ballet's \u201cKaplan New Works\u201d world premiere. Up next: she\u2019s working on a ready-to-wear line to launch her fashion business to a wider audience.\nBen Baumeister\n29 | Senior Director of Event Strategy, Cincinnati Open\nSince starting as an intern in the ticketing department at pro tennis\u2019 Cincinnati Open in 2017, Ben Baumeister now leads a team of seasonal and full-time employees as the senior director of event strategy. While he says no two days look the same, he typically works with the marketing teams on strategy, the design team on implementing new structures in the stadium, or other partnering companies on how to collaborate with the Open and its players. The plan is paying off: In 2023, attendance jumped 25% to nearly 200,000 people from across the world.\nZachary Beller & Aaron Chow\n26, 26 | Cofounders, Vixiv\nCashing in on the hype around artificial intelligence, Zachary Beller and Aaron Chow founded Vixiv, an AI-enabled 3D printing software company, in 2019. To date, the startup has raised $3 million from investors including CincyTech and Cintrifuse. The company\u2019s AI software and 3D printing technology helps engineers design prototypes for aerospace, defense, automotive, medical and industrial tools. On top of Vixiv, Beller is a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and Georgia Institute of Technology President\u2019s Fellow.\nTaylor Berling\n26 | Founder, Inner Vision Pilates\nTaylor Berling gave up a career in accounting to pursue her side-hustle full time. After teaching pilates at a local studio for a year, Berling founded her own boutique pilates studio Inner Vision Pilates in March 2023. The company brought in $130,000 in 2023 revenue selling single group classes for $32 and monthly subscriptions for $250. Berling says she sells over 200 spots to her classes each week. But Berling isn\u2019t giving up on her talent with numbers. She holds the record for the highest score in the state of Kentucky on the CPA exam and, when she\u2019s not in the studio, continues to manage accounting for three businesses.\nCaroline Blackburn\n29 | Senior Manager of Digital Strategy, Cincinnati Bengals\nFor Caroline Blackburn, the senior manager of digital strategy at the Cincinnati Bengals, football is a family affair. Her grandfather, Mike Brown, owns the team, which Forbes recently valued at $3.5 billion. She took on this role in 2021 following her time working on ecommerce leadership teams at Petco and Walmart. Since joining the Bengals, she has guided digital projects in data, ticketing and targeted marketing. Blackburn also leads stadium projects, including the planning, construction and naming-rights sponsorship for the indoor practice facility and the implementation of new technologies like LED, digital menu boards, TVs and audio. She is currently overseeing a $100 million investment into the stadium facility.\nJoe Burrow\n27 | Quarterback, Cincinnati Bengals\nSince growing up less than 200 miles from Cincinnati, in Athens, Ohio, Joe Burrow has gone on to become a hometown hero and star of the Bengals football franchise. He was the first pick overall in the 2020 NFL draft after winning the Heisman trophy in 2019. As quarterback with the Bengals, Burrow led the franchise to its first playoff victory in 31 years in 2021, and led the team to the Superbowl in 2022. Burrow signed a five-year contract extension prior to the 2023 opener that made him the highest-paid quarterback in the NFL. He is also a founder of the Joe Burrow Foundation, a nonprofit aimed at helping children with mental illness, those experiencing food insecurity and other underprivileged communities.\nLaura Castillo\n26 | Director, City of Cincinnati Department of Economic Inclusion\nThe youngest director in history for the City of Cincinnati, Laura Castillo is the director of the department of economic inclusion, which acts as a growth catalyst for local businesses. She has worked in community impact initiatives for nearly ten years and is the first Hispanic director for her department. Under her leadership, the city has processed 366 certification applications for minority, women and local business owners in the last year. As a result of her efforts, the City of Cincinnati spent over $5 million in the first quarter of 2024 on contracts directed to local, minority and women businesses.\nJa'Marr Chase\n24 | Wide Receiver, Cincinnati Bengals\nCincinnati's first-round pick in the 2021 NFL draft, Ja\u2019Marr Chase signed a $30.8 million four-year deal with the Bengals. As a wide receiver, he led the team in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns in each of his first three seasons. Chase also earned Pro Bowl honors each year from 2021 to 2023. He counts 1.3 million followers on Instagram and has partnered with brands like Nike Football\u2014with whom he launched a pair of signature cleats\u2014Bose headphones, and 7Eleven.\nEmilee Chinn\n26 | Photographer\nEmilee Chinn is a photographer for the Cincinnati Reds, Getty Images and the Associated Press. Currently the Reds\u2019 team photographer, she\u2019s also held roles as photo editor and assistant for the NHL\u2019s Columbus Blue Jackets, a staff photographer for Ohio Athletics and a gameday photographer for the MLS\u2019s Columbus Crew SC. She has worked with the NFL, NBA, WNBA, NHL and MLS. Chinn was awarded honorable mention for the \"Portfolio\" and \"Action\" categories in the 2023 Professional Baseball Photographers\u2019 Association photo contest and she won gold in the 75th College Photographer of the Year Competition. Her work has been featured across Sports Illustrated and ESPN.\nChase Crawford\n28 | Founder, Four By Three\nAt age 20, Chase Crawford founded Four By Three as an independent film production company, producing nearly a dozen feature films from 2017 to 2020.

        "article": "FC Cincinnati proudly announces the launch of its 2024 Kit, dubbed the \"Canvas Kit.\" This initiative shines a light on the city's arts community and empowers local artists to express their creativity in alignment with the core values and vision of the club. Select artists transformed the actual 2024 Kit into their canvas, while others created their own masterpieces on alternative mediums. Through this collaboration, FCC aims to bridge the worlds of art and sports, celebrating the similarities between soccer and artistic self-expression while showcasing the talent of several local artists and their contribution to our rich artistic culture. FC Cincinnati is excited to announce that the artwork created through the Canvas Kit Reveal will be available at auction, with 100% of the profits going directly to the artists.\nAdonte Clark\n\" My name is Adonte Clark. As an artist, I look to create an impact through the work of art I share with the world. Visual arts connects me with others and drives conversation around important subjects. I primarily use mixed media, on canvas to capture integral linkages to the community and culture to narrate diverse stories. Gifting Cincy was a great change in discipline to highlight a beloved sports team and a gift it is to Cincinnati. \"\nDeja Fletcher\n\" My name is Deja, based in Ohio. I\u00e2m a 27-year-old artist. I specialize in different mediums using acrylic, oil, spray paint, chalk and airbrushing. Also engaging with the community in different art activities to help people express emotions through art. I\u00e2ve done murals in downtown Cincinnati - as well as designing and painting murals with fellow artists. \"\nFrank Brown\n\" Frank Brown, a Cincinnati native, defied convention. Initially chasing an athletic dream after graduating from Walnut Hills High School in 2016, he committed to Ohio Wesleyan University for football. Yet, his path took an unexpected turn when he chose to major in Fine Arts. While focusing on graphic design and computer imaging, he discovered a passion for photography, sculpting, and drawing. Today, he is a graduate student at the University of Cincinnati School of Design, Art, Architecture, and Planning studying architecture and showcasing the beauty of embracing one\u00e2s own path. \"\nKyle Penunuri\n\" Making things has always been my main focus. The production of art has dominated my making. Out of high school, I was set to attend Otis-Parsons school of art and design in California, instead I traveled Europe and hitchhiked the US for several years. My travels landed me in New Orleans where I started training to be a chef and then a goldsmith. I enjoined the high craft of jewelry making and eventually moved to Huntsville Alabama to work with Kathy Chan, a world-renowned designer.\nI had a one person show set up by a friend in Cincinnati. The curator for the Cincinnati Contemporary Art Center attended the show and advised me to go to art school, introducing me to The Art Academy of Cincinnati. I traveled around the country to look at a few art schools and The Art Academy of Cincinnati seemed the best fit. I loved the Art Academy and the city. I earned my master's degree at DAAP. These days my attention has been in old world methods of food production and preserving and other antique methods of day-to-day life. No matter what endeavors and pursuits I take art making is a primary daily practice in essence it\u00e2s the fuel that keeps me wanting to learn. \"\nLee Vest\n\" Having always been a starry-eyed dreamer and escapist at heart, Lee Vest\u00e2s entire entity continues to seep into his artistic expressions. A recent graduate of Northern Kentucky University where he discovered and developed his love for oil painting, he has lived in Cincinnati his entire life, knowing full well the potential daydreams he hopes to bring to life.\nThere are many ways that Lee tackles his creative endeavors, many of which are founded and built upon by the beauty of music. Once a transcending melody is at play, his paintbrush carries him to realms far beyond humanity\u00e2s comprehension, allowing him to craft works that are uniquely his. A number of pieces he has created in his solace are inspired by songs and refrains that have impacted him, fulfilling his imagination that longs to run free.\nOil painting serves as his favored medium for its emotive traits and spectrum of color. It remains one of the most mature forms of art to utilize. And yet, many of Lee\u00e2s paintings possess a childlike quality that allow viewers to reflect deeply. He wishes to remind audiences that their childhood days were the boon that fostered their imagination. When life throws a challenge our way, it is essential to recognize the joy our childhoods brought us, and channel it to power through. Though the future is bright, we must never forget where our dreams originated, so that the mark we choose to make can unify our being. \"\nRomain Mayambi\n\" Romain Mayambi, originally from DRC Congo, moved to the United States with his family approximately ten years ago. He developed an interest in photography during his freshman year of college, driven by his fascination with fashion and the desire to capture and document it.\nRomain would often wander around his campus, spotting individuals with captivating outfits, and would approach them to request permission for a photoshoot. This routine continued for about a year and a half, during which he honed both his photography and communication skills. Romain is proud to state that the experiences gained during that period have equipped him with the ability to effectively engage with clients and approach photography from a unique perspective. \"",

        "title": "Mindfulness Apps In a Stepped Care Model",
        "article": "The demand for mental health services has seen a significant surge in recent years, driven by increasing awareness of mental health issues and the stressors of modern life. However, this demand has not been met with a corresponding increase in the availability of mental health professionals, leading to long wait times and unmet needs for many individuals. This gap between the need for and availability of behavioral health services poses a significant challenge, contributing to the worsening of mental health conditions as patients wait for their turn to receive care. In this context, digital interventions, such as mindfulness apps, have emerged as pivotal tools that can provide immediate support and relief.\nDigital mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer a promising solution to bridge this gap. These tools leverage the widespread use of smartphones, making them accessible to a large segment of the population, including socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. By providing support through easily accessible digital platforms, DMHIs can help mitigate barriers such as lack of time, privacy concerns, and cost. Meta-analyses have shown that DMHIs incorporating evidence-based treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness can effectively reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Despite their proven efficacy, the comparative effectiveness of different DMHIs remained underexplored.\nThe Stepped-Care Model\nThe stepped-care model is an approach to mental health treatment that prioritizes the use of the least intensive yet effective interventions as the initial step in care. This model ensures that patients receive timely and appropriate levels of care based on their needs, escalating to more intensive services only when necessary. By integrating digital interventions such as mindfulness apps into the first step of this model, healthcare providers can offer immediate support to clients or patients, reducing the burden on traditional mental health services and minimizing the negative impact of long wait times.\nThe Study\nThis article summarizes a recently published study in the JAMA Network Open (2024), by Adam Horowitz and colleagues. It presents a comparative study of three types of digital interventions\u2014mindfulness-based, CBT-based, and personalized feedback apps\u2014used as part of a stepped-care approach to manage mental health symptoms in adults seeking behavioral services.\nObjective\nThe study aimed to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness apps and CBT-based apps compared to personalized feedback-only interventions in improving mental health symptoms. Additionally, it explored whether combining these digital interventions with personalized feedback could enhance their effectiveness.\nStudy Design\nThe randomized clinical trial was conducted between May 13, 2020, and December 12, 2022, involving 2079 participants from the University of Michigan Health System. Participants, who were adults seeking outpatient behavioral services, were randomized into one of five intervention arms:\n- Personalized feedback (EPF) only\n- Silvercloud (a CBT app) only\n- Silvercloud plus EPF\n- Headspace (a mindfulness app) only\n- Headspace plus EPF\nThe primary outcome measured was the change in depressive symptoms, with secondary outcomes including anxiety, suicidality, and substance use symptoms. The interventions were delivered through mobile applications, and participants were followed up for six weeks.\nLiterature Review\nPrevious studies have highlighted the potential of DMHIs in addressing mental health symptoms. For instance, Silvercloud, which delivers CBT strategies through text, videos, and journaling exercises, has shown significant benefits in reducing depression and anxiety. Similarly, Headspace, which offers guided meditations and mindfulness practices, has demonstrated efficacy in improving mental health outcomes. Personalized feedback interventions, which provide users with tips and strategies based on their data, have also been effective in supporting better health behaviors. However, the comparative effectiveness of these interventions when used as part of a stepped-care model has not been thoroughly investigated.\nResults\n- Participants\n- The study included 2079 participants with a mean age of 36.8 years, 68.4% of whom were women.\n- Baseline depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with an average score of 12.7.\n- Primary Outcome \u2013 Depression\n- All intervention arms showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms after six weeks, with no significant differences in the magnitude of change across the five groups.\n- Depression scores decreased by an average of 2.5 points from baseline across all interventions.\n- Secondary Outcomes \u2013 Anxiety, Suicidality, and Substance Use\n- Anxiety symptoms, measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, improved significantly across all intervention arms, with no significant differences between groups.\n- Suicidality, assessed using the Positive and Negative Suicidal Ideation (PANSI) scales, showed greater improvement in the Headspace arms compared to the Silvercloud arms.\n- Substance use did not show significant changes during the study period across any intervention arm.\nDiscussion\nThese findings suggest that incorporating mindfulness apps and other digital interventions into a stepped-care model can effectively reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms among adults seeking behavioral services. The study highlights that no single digital intervention was superior, indicating that these tools can be flexibly integrated as the first step in a stepped-care approach, providing timely support and reducing the burden on mental health services.\nImplications for Practice\nThe following additional information was offered:\n- Accessibility and Utility\n- Mindfulness apps and other mental health digital interventions can be readily integrated into mental health care practices, providing accessible support to patients as an initial step in the stepped-care model.\n- These tools can mitigate the impact of prolonged wait times for formal mental health services, offering immediate relief and support.\n- Supplemental Support\n- While digital interventions alone may not replace traditional mental health care, they offer valuable supplemental support within a stepped-care framework, helping to manage symptoms and improve patient outcomes.\n- Personalization and Engagement\n- The inclusion of personalized feedback can enhance the effectiveness of digital interventions, although this study found minimal differences between combined and standalone interventions.\nThis randomized clinical trial compared the effectiveness of several DMHIs for patients awaiting behavioral services. Depression and anxiety symptoms decreased consistently across all interventions, and there was minimal evidence that specific applications were generally better than others. The findings highlight the potential for DMHIs to be offered as supplemental or adjunctive tools within healthcare systems. While the modest magnitude of improvement does not suggest DMHIs can replace formal mental health care services, they can serve an important role in supporting patients during waiting list\u2013related delays in care.\nConclusion\nIn strong support of thoughtful clinicians using well-developed apps with patients and clients, Telehealth.org has carried numerous articles about effective apps, including which apps to use, digital meditation apps, mobile mindfulness meditation, mindfulness apps & online intervention programs, mindfulness apps in the workplace, as well as the dangers of not knowing enough about an app, only to have its developers sell healthcare information to data brokers.\nThe comparative effectiveness of mindfulness apps and other digital mental health interventions within a stepped-care model highlights their potential role in addressing many mental health care gaps. As technology continues to evolve, these tools can provide crucial initial support, reducing the burden on traditional services and improving patient outcomes. The integration of mindfulness apps and other digital interventions into a stepped-care model represents a promising strategy to enhance mental health care accessibility and effectiveness. By offering immediate, low-intensity support, these tools can help manage symptoms and provide much-needed relief while patients await more intensive behavioral services. This approach not only addresses the current shortage of mental health professionals but also promotes a more efficient and patient-centered care system.

        "article": "Mindfulness is a type of Buddhist-based meditation in which you focus on being aware of what you\u2019re sensing, thinking and feeling in the present moment.\nA 2022 study, using a sample of 953 people in the U.S. who meditated regularly, showed that over 10% of participants experienced adverse effects which had a significant negative impact on their everyday life and lasted for at least one month.\nAccording to a review of over 40 years of research that was published in 2020, the most common adverse effects are anxiety and depression. These are followed by psychotic or delusional symptoms, dissociation or depersonalization, and fear or terror.\nWhile this is happening, the Loma Linda School of Behavioral Health is promoting \u2018mindfulness\u2019 to reduce stress, including \u2018guided\u2019 discussions. As one person said in 2013 \u201cWhatever the world can do, the church can do ten years later \u2014 and worse.\"\nResearch also found that adverse effects can happen to people without previous mental health problems and to those who have only had moderate exposure to meditation, and they can lead to long-lasting symptoms.\nThe Western world has had evidence about these adverse effects for a long time. In 1976, Arnold Lazarus, a key figure in the cognitive-behavioral science movement, said that eastern meditation could induce \u201cserious psychiatric problems such as depression, agitation, and even schizophrenic decompensation.\u201d\nThe western world is engaged in the domestication of pagan myths for the psychological \u2018help\u2019 of the masses, and our world-loving institutions are right there, feeding at the hog trough.

It is made possible with funding from the\nMichigan Health Endowment Fund\n.\nMichigan preschoolers often present behavioral health issues. Some have anxiety disorders that make them feel scared or panicked in front of their teachers or classmates. Others may exhibit attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that causes them to have trouble focusing or makes them overly active. Those living with autism may have poor social skills and difficulty with communication. And preschoolers with behavior disorders can be aggressive, feel angry toward others, and easily lose their tempers.\n\"Our preschoolers' behavior issues create an emotional dysregulation or a lack of ability to sustain what we would typically expect in terms of upset,\" says Codi Benjamin, children's program director for the\nCommunity Action Agency\n, which administers Head Start programs in Jackson, Hillsdale, and Lenawee counties. \"What's manifesting for us in Jackson County is higher rates of physical aggression \u2014 hitting, kicking, biting, maybe throwing, pulling hair. We're utilizing our mental health consultants more than we have in the past.\"\nTo help address the behavioral health needs of the littles in Jackson County's Head Start program, Benjamin recently welcomed a pilot project that introduces mindfulness activities to its preschoolers and their families. The pilot is based on research conducted by Dr. Jiying Ling, associate professor and PhD program assistant director at the\nMichigan State University College of Nursing\n, who has been conducting research in Michigan to promote preschoolers' health for over 10 years.\nHead Start students at St. John's Universal Church of Christ in Jackson learn about cucumbers and dragonfruit in a lesson on mindful eating.\n\"I work collaboratively with daycare teachers and parents to develop interventions to promote not only children's physical health but also their mental health.\" Ling says. \"Our previous research shows that mindfulness activities \u2014 such as mindful eating, deep breathing \u2014 can help children to have gratitude toward foods and calming [their] mood.\"\nAddressing challenges through mindfulness\nBenjamin notes that the Head Start program has higher rates of students with disabilities causing language delay. As a result, they lack the skills needed to talk through their feelings and emotions.\n\"We're seeing increasing rates of children who are experiencing trauma, especially in our agency,\" she says. \"A majority of our students are through foster care or Child Protective Services or below 100% of the poverty guidelines, so we're seeing rates of behavioral health concerns in our classrooms expanding.\"\nIn addition, she believes the COVID-19 pandemic has had a lasting impact on students, parents, and staff. While preschoolers generally have opportunities to interact with peers and community members during their first three years of life, those born during 2020 and 2021 have not all had those opportunities. Meeting other kids in the classroom can be difficult.\n\"Children's needs are a little different. Families' needs are a little bit different,\" Benjamin says.\nThe new pilot study, funded by the\nNational Center for Complementary and\nIntegrative Health\n, will test whether and how mindfulness-based food-body-mind interventions can optimize young children's cognitive function and behavioral health. The goal is to give kids some tools to help them relax and manage unpleasant feelings. The interventions include yoga, deep breathing, and mindful movement. The program also emphasizes mindful eating, a novel approach among youth mindfulness programs.\n\"We teach children to use five senses to learn various fruits and vegetables, pay attention while eating, eat slowly, and sense their body and stomach to decide how much to eat. This can help them build a positive relationship with foods,\" Ling says. \"We hope they will build the important resilience to help them handle future life events in a thoughtful and mindful way.\"\nHead Start students at St. John's Universal Church of Christ in Jackson learn about cucumbers and dragonfruit in a lesson on mindful eating.\nMindful eating both calms the classroom and helps picky eaters broaden the range of what they will eat to include healthier foods like fresh fruits and vegetables. Children are more likely to try a new food in the company of their peers than at home under parental pressure.\nOne parent in the pilot shared this with Ling, regarding their daughter: \"There were things that she had never tried, and she would not try them, but now she'll eat the different fruits or vegetables, and she'll tell you what they are and if she likes them or not.\"\nWith diet-related diseases and conditions like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and eating disorders on the rise, mindful eating makes perfect sense. Another parent shared, \"My 4-year-old has been so health conscious lately, eating many fruits and veggies and even stopped putting sugar on her strawberries.\"\nHead Start students at St. John's Universal Church of Christ in Jackson learn about cucumbers and dragonfruit in a lesson on mindful eating.\nThe mindfulness pilot also involves parents. By helping parents to learn and practice mindful eating, mindful movement, and mindful parenting at home, parents will learn how to bring awareness, attention, and curiosity into their interactions with their children.\n\"This can promote positive relationships between parents and children and foster a happy home environment for children's growth and development,\" Ling says. \"We will teach parents to practice mindful communication with family members \u2014 bringing their attention to their breathing, opening their mind to what they are saying, knowing how to ask the right questions, using active listening by mirroring or matching their facial expressions or behaviors, and replying with encouragement.\"\nBenjamin believes it's important to involve parents in the mindfulness activities, not only because parents are a child's first teachers but also because what happens outside of the school day has just as much or more impact on a child's development.\nHead Start students at St. John's Universal Church of Christ in Jackson learn about cucumbers and dragonfruit in a lesson on mindful eating.\n\"We encourage parents to engage with their children in appropriate ways,\" she says. \"What we're hearing from parents has been most helpful. They are excited to learn how to respond if a tantrum is happening and how to regulate themselves if they have a lot of stressors affecting them.\"\nWhile data on the pilot haven't been evaluated yet, the pilot is already receiving positive feedback from the teachers and parents participating in it.\nMindfulness in other Michigan schools\nUsing mindfulness to help children regulate their emotions and build resiliency is not new to Michigan classrooms. Programs like\nMindful Schools\n, the University of Michigan\nTRAILS\nprogram, and\nInner Explorer\n's Mindful Michigan bring similar mindfulness activities to schools around the state.\nInner Explorer is a national nonprofit focused on transforming mental health, academic achievement, and school safety from the inside out. About 5,000 schools across the country use its programs.\n\"Mindful Michigan began just a few years ago with this vision of being able to reach every child in the state with access to proactive prevention and support around mental health in response to the national mental health crisis,\" says David Metler, Inner Explorer regional director for the Midwest. \"We need more adults who are trained to handle the challenges that our youth are facing, the chronic stress, trauma, and anxiety over safety.\"\nMetler finds it inspiring to see preschool students develop mindfulness skills that increase their capacity to regulate their own behaviors and build resilience that helps them overcome traumas.\n\"The great success of Head Start programs is really about early intervention and supports for success,\" he says. \"Seeing the research, it really would be a disservice to not have access to these types of supports that are so critical for dealing with chronic stress and trauma. For youth even as young as preschoolers to really start to tap into their own inner voice and have this experience of being able to choose wisely \u2014 to not be stuck in their emotions.\"\nThe Inner Explorer platform for preschoolers entails a daily five-minute practice and additional one- to two-minute transition practices. Principal Erin Dixon of\nFortis Academy\nin Ypsilanti reported that the platform resulted in a 16% year-over-year decrease in \"behavior events.\" Across the country, schools participating in Inner Explorer programs have seen a more than\n60% decrease in behavior issues\n.\n\"We're also seeing an increase in academic success,\" Metler says. \"It's not surprising \u2014 being able to settle in and be ready to learn and having these skills around attention and focus are key.\"\nEstelle Slootmaker is a working writer focusing on journalism, book editing, communications, poetry, and children's books.

        "title": "Frontiers | Mindfully Green and Healthy: An Indirect Path from Mindfulness to Ecological Behavior",
        "article": "- 1Department of Individual Differences and Psychological Assessment, Institute of Psychology and Education, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany\n- 2Department of Social Psychology, Faculty of the Natural Sciences, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany\n- 3Department of Economic Education and Sustainable Consumption, Institute for Vocational Training and Work Studies, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany\nThis paper examines the nature of the link between mindfulness and ecological behavior. Based on the notion that mindfulness incorporates heightened awareness of bodily sensations, we suggest an indirect path from mindfulness to ecological behavior that is mediated through individual health behavior, such as improved nutrition and increased exercise. This indirect path is corroborated with two online studies (n = 147/n = 239) where mindfulness, personal health behavior and ecological behavior were assessed. We conclude that increased mindful awareness of momentary experience indeed favors more healthy lifestyles, which in turn relate to increased ecological behavior beyond personal health benefits. The findings support an agreeableness of personal and planetary health behavior and open up a path for environmental educational interventions based on mindfulness practices and personal health gains.\nIntroduction: Mindfulness and Ecological Behavior\nThere has been a growing research interest in mindfulness over the last decade, spurred by the manifold positive effects of mindfulness evidenced in diverse fields as psychological and physical health (Grossman et al., 2004), cognitive functioning (e.g., Malinowski, 2013), and affective states (e.g., Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010). That mindfulness might also be positively related to ecological behavior has been suggested in various recent studies (e.g., Brown and Kasser, 2005; Amel et al., 2009; Barbaro and Pickett, 2015; Panno et al., 2017). Since the concepts of mindfulness and ecological behavior applied in these studies vary considerably, we start by defining both concepts.\nBased on the works of Kabat-Zinn (1991) and Bishop et al. (2004) we define mindfulness as the awareness of momentary experiences with a non-identified, unbiased, open, and accepting attitude. The definition comprises the two recurring aspects of mindfulness described in the literature as awareness and acceptance (Rau and Williams, 2016). The first aspect is expressed in heightened awareness for internal and external stimuli and sensations and the capacity to act consciously without being distracted (acting with awareness, e.g., Baer et al., 2008). The second aspect refers to the quality of the attitude in which people experience this awareness, namely accepting and non-identified, expressed in the ability to impartially allow whatever sensation or thought arises in a given moment without identifying with it, evaluating it or reacting to it (see also Bishop et al., 2004). Authors who emphasize the root in Buddhist ethics, regard an inner stance of equanimity, openness, and friendliness as an integral aspect of mindfulness (Shapiro and Carlson, 2009; Grossman, 2015). Despite this multifaceted nature of the construct, various authors give factor-analytical evidence for the existence of a general mindfulness factor (Walach et al., 2006; Baer et al., 2008; Bergomi et al., 2014). The general characteristic of being mindful as a state accompanying and following meditation practice, is also considered an individual difference that can be cultivated via meditation practice over time (Kabat-Zinn, 2003; Rau and Williams, 2016).\nFurthermore, we define ecological behavior in line with environmental psychology approaches as behaviors that protect/avoid harm to the environment and span all areas of life such as nutrition, mobility and transportation, energy and water consumption, waste avoidance, and consumerism (Kaiser, 1998; Gatersleben et al., 2002; Brown and Kasser, 2005; Steg and Vlek, 2009; Geiger et al., 2017). In terms of Stern's theory toward environmentally significant behavior (Stern, 2000) we focus on individual, private sphere conservation behaviors that were successfully related to dispositional mindfulness in former studies.\nThat mindfulness could be related to sustainable individual behavioral choices was first suggested in the field of consumer research, where mindfulness is believed to play the role of an antagonist to impulsive, automated acquisition habits that amount to unsustainable consumerism (Kottler, 1999; Rosenberg, 2004). In a recent systematic literature review, Fischer et al. (2017) identified three more potential ways in which mindfulness could exert a positive effect on ecological behaviors in general, namely the closure of the so-called attitude-behavior gap, re-orientation toward non-materialistic, simple lifestyles, and cultivation of pro-social, compassionate behaviors.\nWe will outline the latter two potential ways, relevant to our own approach. Ericson et al. (2014) summarize existing evidence on how increased mindfulness may lead people to re-think their values and increase subjective well-being independently from material consumption. In various studies mindfulness was related to increased subjective wellbeing and life satisfaction (Brown et al., 2009) and the endorsement of intrinsic, non-materialistic values and ecological conservation behaviors (e.g., Brown and Kasser, 2005).\nUnveiling a further potential of mindfulness to increase ecological behavior, various studies have shown that mindfulness meditation increases pro-social behavior (Leiberg et al., 2011) and compassion for other people (Lim et al., 2015), both eventually increasing ecological behavior (Corral Verdugo et al., 2011; Pfattheicher et al., 2015; Geiger and Keller, 2017). More directly, Panno et al. (2017) showed that a positive relationship between trait mindfulness and ecological behavior was mediated through decreased social dominance orientation using a known group approach. This personality trait of questioning existing inequalities between social groups has been repeatedly shown to relate to environmentalism (Milfont et al., 2017). Barbaro and Pickett (2015) focused on biospheric instead of altruistic concerns and showed that the relationship of mindfulness on ecological behavior is mediated by their connectedness to nature (Mayer and Frantz, 2004). In an experimental study by Tang et al. (2017), biospheric and altruistic cognitive foci were compared to a selfish focus. Results indicated that mindful learning techniques are only instrumental for ecological behavior when the mind is set on the environment or other people, but could be detrimental if a selfish focus is predominant.\nSo far, studies that empirically tested the supposed relationship between mindfulness and ecological behavior used different mediators, widely varying operationalizations of both concepts and report partially inconsistent correlations at the facet level of mindfulness (see Table 1). Most of these studies focused on self-transcendental values according to Schwartz's (1992) value model, such as pro-social, altruist, or biospheric concerns. In contrast, we suggest a mediation model based on self-enhancement, namely the improvement of personal health. Thus, we challenge the notion that an egoistic orientation is necessarily detrimental to environmental outcomes.\nTable 1. Comparative first order correlations found between different facets of mindfulness and different ecological behavior measures.\nThe Mediation Model: An Indirect Path from Mindfulness to Ecological Behavior via Health Behavior\nThat mindfulness practice entails health and environmental co-benefits at the same time was suggested in a recent conceptual paper by Barrett et al. (2016). Unlike Barrett et al. who explicitly bank on positive side-effects of mindfulness-induced-behaviors (as e.g., vegetarian nutrition) on health and the environment, we propose a mediation model beyond simple co-benefits, in which increased mindfulness ignites increased health behavior, which in turn is positively related to general ecological behavior even without health benefits (see Figure 1). This supposition is backed up by a substantial body of empirical research for path a (from mindfulness to health behavior). For path b (from health behavior to ecological behavior) there are various conceptual considerations and recent evidence suggesting such a relation.\nPath a\nVarious studies evidence the positive effects of mindfulness on psychological and physical health (Grossman et al., 2004; Brown et al., 2007). Based on this effect, mindfulness trainings were initially designed to treat chronic pain patients (Kabat-Zinn, 1982) and its applications were later expanded to alleviate symptoms of a wide range of (severe) illnesses (Grossman et al., 2004). Positive mental health effects comprise increased well-being, emotional stability or reduced rumination and stress (Brown and Ryan, 2003; Eberth and Sedlmeier, 2012). Especially relevant for our mediation model are the numerous studies that show how dispositional mindfulness is positively related to a variety of health behaviors (Roberts and Danoff-Burg, 2010). Furthermore, mindfulness training can support people to build new health routines for a range of behaviors such as exercising, dieting, and healthy eating (Gilbert and Waltz, 2010; Beshara et al., 2013; Salmoirago-Blotcher et al., 2013; Bahl et al., 2016). Mindfulness practice has also been reported to play a positive role in risk related health choices such as substance abuse and smoking (Black et al., 2012; Karyadi et al., 2014). Overall, a general positive effect of mindfulness practice on the intentions to take care of one's body and the ability to implement these intentions has been evidenced (Chatzisarantis and Hagger, 2007; Dutton, 2008; Ruffault et al., 2016). We see one reason for the observed effects in the nature of prominent mindfulness practices: they are focused on inner bodily processes and sensations, as observing the breath or body parts for prolonged periods of time. Moreover, mindfulness is partially defined as a heightened awareness for inner, bodily sensations in the present moment (Kabat-Zinn, 1991; Bishop et al., 2004). This heightened awareness can serve as a motivational basis for the implementation of healthier lifestyles, as expressed in healthier eating or increased exercise.\nPath b\nThe fact that a lot of health behaviors have co-benefits for the environment and vice versa is seen as one reason for an apparent relationship between health and ecological behavior and was exploited by Barrett et al. (2016) for their climate-activism mindfulness training. Biking to work, eating more organic and non-processed food, or moderate home temperature settings are all examples for behaviors that are beneficial to individual health while also protecting natural resources and could be framed as either (Bopp et al., 2011). Beyond direct co-benefits, the idea of a general interdependence between human and planetary health has been the focus of conceptual work by Nisbet and Gick (2008). The authors stress the dependency of human health on an intact environment and the need for environmental protection as a precondition for leading a healthy life. This notion was empirically tested for women's health behaviors, as being especially vulnerable to environmental depletion. Kim (2017) showed, that woman's individual health behavior in a South Korean sample was substantially correlated with sustainable consumption behaviors, and to a lesser degree with vicarious, social-sustainable behavior, and chemical exposure prevention (the latter being a case of behavior with co-benefits in both areas).\nOther authors (Kjell, 2011; Corral Verdugo, 2012) focus on the positive consequences of sustainable behavior, such as increased (psychological) well-being, that helps spurring a positive feedback loop and asserts a positive relation between ecological behavior and health. These general thoughts are supported by the fact that throughout different nations and cultures, nature settings are appreciated for recreational purposes including health benefits (Maller et al., 2006) and well-being (Carrus et al., 2017) which in turn, is also a strong motivation for ecological behavior. Hartig et al. (2001) found, for example, that fascination with natural scenery and perceived usefulness for intended activities (including exercising) predicted general ecological behavior measured with the same instrument than in the current study. If the general line of argumentation is true, we should be able to observe a positive relation between health and ecological behavior even when direct co-benefits are absent (e.g., recycling, conserving energy and water, or buying reusable household products).\nIn contrast to the existing conceptualizations of the relation between mindfulness and ecological behavior, our proposed mediation model is based on a self-interest to enhance one's own health and well-being. Thus, we call it\u2014non-judgmentally\u2014an \u201cegocentric\u201d path that goes beyond simple co-benefits as it relates to ecological behavior without explicit health benefits. Behind this background, the main aim of this study is to test, if the relation between mindfulness and ecological behavior is mediated by health behavior. This aim is pursued in two independent studies (see Figures 1, 2).\nMethod of Study 1 and 2\nAs the two studies only differed in terms of the scale used to measure mindfulness and incorporated covariates, they are reported together. The second study was included to add empirical evidence to the passionate debate on the true nature of mindfulness and its adequate assessment (e.g., Brown et al., 2011; Grossman, 2011). That mindfulness is not only a heightened capacity for paying attention, but additionally characterized by an ethical mind-set, is not fully accounted for in the KIMS scale used in study 1 (Baer et al., 2004), unlike the CHIME scale used in study 2 (Bergomi et al., 2014). This scale, validated in German, was published only after the design of study 1 in 2014, why we run a replication study with this improved measurement of our core construct.\nProcedure\nTwo convenience samples were recruited in social networks within a German university context, between December 2014 and February 2015 (study 1) and December 2015 and March 2016 (study 2). No reimbursement was paid. Respondents completed an online-questionnaire that assessed mindfulness, ecological behavior, health behavior, socio demographics, and three control questions about previous experience with mindfulness practices (only study 1). If more than 6 answers were missing (marking a gap in the frequency distribution of missing data), data was excluded from analysis. The studies were conducted according the ethical guidelines for online studies of the German Society for Online Research (DGOF, 2007). Consent of each participant was requested in digital form on the first page of the survey and anonymity of participants was guaranteed.\nParticipants\nStudy 1\nOf the initial 179 voluntary participants who started the questionnaire, 147 completed it, of which 59.2% were female. Mean age was 28.5 years (ranging from 17 to 60), with an overrepresentation of students (61.9%, compared to other work/professional situations: 23.8% employed, 5.4% self-employed and 3.4% currently jobless). The sample is highly educated (40.8% with a university entrance diploma and another 46.3% with a completed university or tertiary degree). Regarding the three control questions on previous experience with mindfulness practice, more than half of the participants, 52.4%, had heard about the concept of mindfulness before, whereas only 12.2% had participated in a mindfulness training and 2% (3 persons) identified themselves as Buddhist.\nStudy 2\nOf the initial convenience sample of 295 participants, n = 239 completed the questionnaire, of which 67.8% were female. Mean age was 31.8 years (ranging from 18 to 79), with a lower proportion of students (35.1, vs. 44.8% employed, 5.0% self-employed and 4.2% currently on job search). The sample is also highly educated (79.9% with a university entrance diploma and 69.7% with a completed university or tertiary degree).\nMeasures\nMindfulness\nStudy 1 (KIMS)\nTo assess mindfulness, a 20 item long German short version of the Kentucky Inventory on Mindfulness Skills (KIMS; Baer et al., 2004) by H\u00f6fling et al. (2011) was employed. The KIMS scale is aimed at people without meditation experience. The used version measures the four facets of the original scale with 5 items each: non-judging (e.g., \u201cI criticize myself for having irrational or inappropriate emotions\u201d), acting with awareness (e.g., \u201cI am exclusively concentrating on what I am doing\u201c), observing (e.g., \u201cWhen I take a shower I stay alert to the sensation of water on my body\u201d) and describing (e.g., \u201cI am good at finding words to describe my feelings\u201d). The German version showed a good model fit for the 4-factor structure, a reasonable convergent validity with MAAS scale and discriminant validity with the Becks Depression Inventory (H\u00f6fling et al., 2011). The 20 items were rated on a five point Likert scale from 1 (never or rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). The mean score of all 20 items was computed after reverse coding the nine negative items along with the mean scales of the four subfacets, with higher scores indicating a more mindful person. Cronbach's Alphas for the scale and all subscales are reported in Table 2.\nStudy 2 (CHIME)\nThe Comprehensive Inventory of Mindful Experiences by Bergomi et al. (2014) comprises 37 items to measure seven different facets, reflecting the multifaceted nature of mindfulness. The first three, akin to the according KIMS facets, are called acceptance (e.g., \u201cI see my mistakes and difficulties without judging myself\u201d), acting consciously (e.g., \u201cIt is easy for me to stay focused on what I am doing\u201d), awareness (e.g., \u201cWhen I am sitting or lying, I perceive the sensations in my body\u201d). Further facets are called decentering (e.g., \u201cIn difficult situations, I can pause for a moment without reacting immediately\u201d), openness (e.g., \u201cI try to stay busy to keep specific thoughts or feelings from coming to my mind\u201d), relativity (e.g., \u201cIn everyday life, I am aware that my view on things is subjective and does not necessarily correspond to facts\u201d) and loving insight (e.g., \u201cWhen I have needlessly given myself a hard time, I can see it with a bit of humor\u201d). The CHIME showed good convergent validity with a German Version of the FFMQ (Five facets mindfulness questionnaire, Baer et al., 2008) and discriminant validity with the brief symptom inventory (BSI, for detailed information see Bergomi et al., 2014). The 37 items were rated on a six point Likert scale from 0 (never or rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true); seven items are formulated negatively and were reverse coded. Following the example of Bergomi et al. (2014), reporting good model fits for a second order general factor model with seven facets, we computed scale means for each facet and a mean score of all 37 items, with higher scores indicating a more mindful person. Cronbach's Alphas for the scale and all subscales show sufficient reliability (all above 0.7 as reported in Table 2).\nHealth Behavior\nTo assess the health behavior of participants, we employed the German health behavior scale by Byrka and Kaiser (2013) based on the Campbell paradigm (Kaiser et al., 2010) in both studies. This scale consists of 56 health behavior items with a wide range of difficulty on a unidimensional Rash-type model. It comprises behaviors on nutrition, hygiene, stress recovery, risk prevention and physical exercise. The scale has been Rash modeled successfully and has been validated by showing its relation to physical health (e.g., body-mass-index), mental health resources (e.g. self-efficacy) and social health resources (e.g. income) (for more details on the scale's validity, see Byrka and Kaiser, 2013). In a Rasch-type model items as well as persons form a transitive order based on their difficulty. This means that some behaviors are relatively easy, that is, they are performed by most people (e.g., putting on a seat belt in the car) while difficult behaviors are performed by only few, very health dedicated individuals (e.g., eating a gluten free diet). Thus, Rasch scales allow scoring people according to \u201chow far they reach\u201d on a given trait, in this case health behaviors (or environmentalist dedication, see below).\nIn order to test our assumptions as conservatively as possible, we screened the items of the health scale for behaviors that might imply ecological co-benefits, which would artificially increase the correlation between health and ecological behaviors. In an independent rating, two of the authors identified four such items (e.g., \u201cI ride a bike or walk to work or school\u201d) which we subsequently omitted from the scale (for an overview of all applied and excluded items, see supplementary material, Appendix A). Of the remaining 52 items, 27 items (e.g., \u201cI have a hobby\u201d) were answered on a dichotomous scale (yes/no) whereas 25 items (e.g., \u201cI go on day hikes\u201d) were answered on a five-point Likert Scale from 1 (never) to 5 (very often or always). For all items, the option \u201cnot applicable\u201d was available.\nEcological Behavior\nTo assess the level of engagement in ecologically responsible behaviors, a German version of the general ecological behavior scale (GEB) from Kaiser (1998; Kaiser and Wilson, 2000, 2004) also based on the Campbell paradigm was used (for slight differences in versions used in the two studies, see Appendix B). The scale measures ecologically relevant behaviors from various areas, including energy conservation, mobility, waste avoidance and recycling, consumerism, and vicarious, social behaviors toward conservation (Kaiser and Wilson, 2004). The scale has been extensively validated as a unidimensional measure with a wide variety of samples (Kaiser, 1998; Kaiser et al., 1999; Kaiser and Biel, 2000; Kaiser and Wilson, 2004; and shown to predict environmental impact of individual lifestyles, Arnold et al., 2017).\nJust like the items of the health scale, we screened the ecological behaviors for items with health benefits. Three of the 44 behaviors (i.e., 7 of 50 behaviors in study 2) were judged to have health co-benefits, and thus were excluded from the ecological behavior scale. Forty-one items (i.e., 43 items in study 2) entered the Rasch calibration (see Appendix B). Twenty-five of those were being answered on a five-point Likert scale (e.g., \u201cI buy products in refillable packages\u201d) and the 16 remaining items on a dichotomous scale (e.g., \u201cI am a member of a car pool\u201d). For all items, the option \u201cnot applicable\u201d was available.\nSocio-Demographic Variables\nIn addition to age and gender, in study 1 a sum score for increased familiarity with mindfulness was computed from the three control questions. In study 2, average monthly income was assessed additionally. These socio-demographic variables were entered as covariates (age, gender, income along with familiarity) in the mediation model.\nData and Scale Reliability Analysis\nFollowing the logic of the original scale construction, we fitted a Rasch model (Bond and Fox, 2007) for the health and the ecological behavior scales with the package \u201ceRm\u201d (Mair and Hatzinger, 2007) in R 3.2.3. For both scales, answer options were collapsed into a uniform dichotomous answer format (\u201cnever,\u201d \u201cseldom,\u201d and \u201coccasionally\u201d = \u201cno/never\u201d; and \u201coften\u201d and \u201cvery often/always\u201d = \u201cyes/always\u201d). Kaiser and Wilson (2000) have suggested this procedure, because contrary to common expectations, more options on a Likert-scale make answers more arbitrary and less reliable. The quality of a Rasch model is judged on how well the data fit the model. Item infit Mean Square (MS) = 1 express a perfect fit, while values ranging from 0.7 to 1.3 are acceptable (Bond and Fox, 2007). We estimated the person ability score of each respondent in each of the two scales, setting items' mean difficulty to 0. These person ability scores were entered in the mediation analysis with higher values indicating a better performance.\nFor health behaviors, all items fitted well with infit MS, ranging from 0.88 to 1.15 (study 1) and 0.73 to 1.14 (study 2). Item no. 18 (\u201cIn cars, I wear seatbelts\u201d\u2014an obligatory behavior in Germany) was excluded from the analysis, because all respondents answered affirmatively. For ecological behaviors, the infit MS ranged from 0.79 to 1.24 (study 1) and 0.83 to 1.17 (study 2). Two items were answered affirmatively by all respondents (\u201cAfter a picnic, I leave the place as clean as it was originally\u201d and \u201cI reuse my shopping bags\u201d), and thus, did not contribute to the discrimination of persons.\nTo assess the internal consistency of the two Rasch scales, we computed the separation reliability, comparable to Cronbach's alpha. The internal consistency for the health scale in the two studies was acceptable with r = 0.67/0.74 and good for ecological behavior with r = 0.79/0.76. For both mindfulness scales, which were constructed according classic test theory, Cronbach's alpha indicated a good internal consistency (KIMS: \u03b1 = 0.81 and CHIME: \u03b1 = 0.85) and the overall scale means were used in the mediation analysis.\nTo test the significance of the indirect effects of the mediation model in both studies, we ran a bootstrap analysis recommended by Hayes (2009) and Preacher and Hayes (2008), using Model 4 of the PROCESS macro (Version 2.16) for SPSS (Version 23.0) described in Hayes (2012). Following the advice of Preacher and Kelley (2011), we calculated and reported two different types of effect sizes for the indirect effect, namely the completely standardized product of ab (abcs) and the proportion of the indirect effect/total effect (ab/c) which allows to compare the size of the mediation effect of both studies.\nResults\nStudy 1\nThe zero order correlations and descriptive statistics of the three study variables including the mindfulness facets are displayed in Table 2. Mindfulness is positively correlated with health behavior on all facets and to a lesser degree with ecological behavior, were only two of the facets (describe and observe) showed a small, positive relation.\nFurther, we found a substantial correlation between health behavior and ecological behavior, suggesting the existence of an indirect path. Figure 1 shows the standardized regression coefficients and according standard errors for all significant paths of the mediation model.\nA bootstrap analysis testing the indirect effect according to Hayes (2013) using k = 5,000 sampling repetitions revealed a bias-corrected 95% confidence interval excluding the value 0 (point estimate = 0.097, LLCI2.5% = 0.037, ULCI97.5% = 0.201), confirming that health behavior mediates the relation between mindfulness and ecological behavior. The completely standardized size of the indirect effect was abcs = 0.108 or expressed as the ratio to the total effect ab/c = 55.67% (for different option on effect sizes for indirect effect see Preacher and Kelley, 2011).\nFamiliarity with the mindfulness concept, age and gender were entered in the mediation model as direct covariates to the dV. Results showed no effect for either variable (familiarity: \u03b2 = 0.108, p = 0.34; age: \u03b2 = \u22120.002, p = 0.81; gender: \u03b2 = \u22120.081, p = 0.62). The results will be discussed together with the results of study 2.\nStudy 2\nThe zero order correlations and descriptive statistics of the three study variables including the subfacets of mindfulness are displayed in Table 3. Health behavior was related positively with all mindfulness facets except accepting and openness. For ecological behavior a similar pattern emerged, with the only difference that acting consciously was also not related to ecological behavior. Health and ecological behavior, again, were substantially, positively related.\nFigure 2 shows the standardized regression coefficients and according standard errors obtained by running PROCESS with z-standardized variables for all paths.\nAs in study 1, we ran a bootstrap analysis with k = 5,000 repeated samples to test the indirect effect. The bias-corrected 95% bootstrap confidence interval excluded the value 0, indicating an indirect effect of mindfulness on ecological behavior, mediated through health behavior (point estimate = 0.166, LLCI2.5% = 0.082, ULCI97.5% = 0.290). The completely standardized size of the indirect effect was abcs = 0.102 or expressed as the ratio to the total effect ab/c = 37.08% (Preacher and Kelley, 2011). An extended mediation model with age, gender and income as covariates revealed a moderate negative influence of income (\u03b2 = \u22120.165, p = 0.002) on ecological behavior, but neither of age (\u03b2 = \u22120.005, p = 0.35) nor gender (\u03b2 = \u22120.098, p = 0.46).\nDiscussion\nWe corroborated our mediation model, proposing an indirect effect of mindfulness on ecological behavior through personal health behavior in two independent studies.\nIn a first instance, we found a consistent direct effect of mindfulness on ecological behavior (c: \u03b2 = 0.19*/0.27**) in both studies, replicating the findings by Barbaro and Pickett (2015) on a facet level (see Table 1). The awareness/observing facet correlated strongest with ecological behavior, which supports the notion that being aware of one's body and external surroundings are conducive to ecological behavior. The positive relationship of the facets insight and relativity of the CHIME measure explains the stronger total effect in study 2: a certain distance to subjective experience, which is common to both facets, might free up time and energy to engage in more self-transcendental pursuits as ecological behavior. On the other hand, contrary to studies using the MAAS scale (Brown and Kasser, 2005; Panno et al., 2017) acting with awareness was not related to ecological behavior. Acceptance/non-judging also showed a null-effect, pointing toward the possibility that some aspects of cultivating mindfulness might be detrimental for ecological behavior, e.g., through increased compliance or disinterest in changing the\u2014albeit unpleasant\u2014status quo.\nOur main finding though concerns the indirect effect of the relationship between mindfulness and ecological behavior: it was substantially mediated by health behavior. In both studies we found an indirect effect of a comparable standardized effect size (abcs = 0.108/0.102), making up 55.67/37.08% of the total effect c respectively, speaking for the general importance of health behaviors in the mindfulness-ecological behavior relation. Dispositional mindfulness related to our broad measure of health behavior, ranging from eating and hygiene habits, to exercise and risk prevention in both studies (see path a Figures 1, 2). While in the first study all mindfulness facets of the KIMS related equally to health behavior (see Table 2), in the second study, the awareness/observing facet of the CHIME related strongest to health behavior (see Table 3), supporting the idea that being aware of one's own body and the surrounding world might be a driver behind increased health inclinations.\nThat personal health behavior in turn is positively related to general ecological behavior (see path b in Figures 1, 2) extends the findings by Kim (2017) to a general population and a wider range of behaviors. Moreover, this relation does not simply reflect co-benefits, since all such items were excluded (see Appendixes A, B in Supplementary Material). That health conscious people are more likely to also conserve the environment beyond direct personal health gains is noteworthy. It means, that the realization of the interdependency of personal health and ecological, \u201cplanetary\u201d health is empirically reflected in people's behavior (Nisbet and Gick, 2008; Corral Verdugo et al., 2011; Corral Verdugo, 2012). Former research mainly investigated self-transcendental ecocentric or pro-social pathways to ecological behavior (e.g., through connectedness to nature, Barbaro and Pickett, 2015; intrinsic values, Brown and Kasser, 2005, reduced social dominance orientation, Panno et al., 2017). In contrast, our mediation model is based on a self-serving, egocentric interest to improve personal health. In this respect our findings corroborate former research indicating that egocentric self-enhancement values can also advocate conservation of nature for utilization motives (e.g., Milfont and Gouveia, 2006). It also complements recent publications about co-benefits of ecological behavior opening up new ways of promoting environmental action (Corral Verdugo, 2012; Bain et al., 2016). In our case, we provide empiric evidence of why mindfulness environmental educational approaches (Barrett et al., 2016; Stanszus et al., 2017) based on health and ecological co-benefits should be fruitful.\nA strength of the current study is that all paths were tested with validated scales for the respective constructs, comprising a wide variety of subfacets each. The two behavioral scales encompass a great range of relevant behaviors instead of focusing on single behaviors (e.g., smoking or recycling), as often the case in health or environmental studies. That the results have been conceptually replicated with two different mindfulness scales underlines the robustness and general character of the findings.\nNeither familiarity with mindfulness, nor age or gender did explain any proportion of behavioral variance. In the case of age, our young and unrepresentative sample might have prevented a weak relation found in other studies (for an overview of age effects in ecological behavior, see Wiernik et al., 2013; Otto and Kaiser, 2014). Regarding previous exposure to the mindfulness concept, a more detailed measure of actual meditation experience in terms of regularity and length of practice would be desirable in future studies. Assessing previous practice might have yielded more insightful results into the role of actual meditation practice in cultivating sustainable lifestyles than the short measure we used. In the second study, income was a negative predictor of ecological behavior, showing that higher income is usually detrimental to ecological behavior, corroborating findings of representative studies (e.g., Kleinh\u00fcckelkotten et al., 2016). This shows, that ecological behavior could also be partially motivated by saving money, another self-centered motive.\nA caveat all cross-sectional studies face, lays in the inconclusiveness with regards to the assumed causal direction. The mediation analysis of cross-sectional data does not per se warrant the interpretation of an intrapersonal, temporal process (Winer et al., 2016), in our case from mindfulness via health behavior to ecological behavior. Alternative models, e.g., where health problems make people turn simultaneously to mindfulness practices and ecological behavior is theoretically likewise conceivable. For further possible interpretations of mediation models, see Roe (2012). We base the interpretation of our data as an intrapersonal process on former intervention studies, which showed (for path a) that mindfulness practice fosters health behaviors such as balanced nutrition or increased exercise (e.g., Dutton, 2008; Salmoirago-Blotcher et al., 2013). This causal chain has yet to be established for path b in future research with, for example, intervention studies aiming at health behaviors and measuring ecological behaviors as a dependent variable.\nA possible alternative to a causal intrapersonal process includes a common third factor, e.g. an inclination for a nature-related, spiritual lifestyle, which could be more prevalent in our voluntary samples with a propensity for the topic. As connectedness to nature was shown to mediate the relation between mindfulness and ecological behavior in a cross-sectional study similar to ours (Barbaro and Pickett, 2015), their effect could also be interpreted as a third-factor confound instead of a causal process. Appreciation of nature could be another such factor: it is partially fuelled by a health motive, i.e., people seeking restoration effects in nature settings (Maller et al., 2006; Carrus et al., 2017; see also Mercado-Dom\u00e9nech et al., 2017 for a recent discussion on motivation and evaluation in the perception of environmental stimuli) and has been proven to spur ecological behavior (Hartig et al., 2001; Otto et al., 2014). How these phenomena relate to each other and to mindfulness practice, health behavior and ecological behavior, will have to be explored in future studies. Furthermore, a recent study with children showed the positive results of exposure to nature for pro-social outcomes (Carrus et al., 2015) and environmental behavior (Otto and Pensini, 2017). Thus, another promising avenue for future research would be an intervention study combining nature-exposure and mindfulness practices, measuring the outcomes on health and environmental behavior.\nConclusions\nThe presented evidence on the relation between mindfulness and ecological behavior favors a mediation model via personal health behavior and partially supports former research on a direct, modest link between the two concepts. Our findings suggest that the increased ecological behavior of mindful people is an indirect consequence of increased personal health behavior. The overall positive effect of mindfulness on ecological behavior seems to warrant considerations to include mindfulness trainings and practices into the intervention canon of environmental education. A combination of mindfulness and nature experiences might be an effective way to enhance the positive health effects while at the same time promoting ecological behavior. Generally, the results support a new narrative of the compatibility of self-serving, personal, and planetary health benefits which might be a more fruitful approach to promote ecological behavior than mainly cognitive, moral, or normative appeals.\nAuthor Contributions\nSG: Analyzed data, did literature research, concept of the paper, wrote the manuscript, expertise on mindfulness and ecological behavior.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\nfact-checked\npeer-reviewed publication\ntrusted source\nproofread\nMindfulness meditation can help address the teen mental health crisis, researcher says\nIn a paper published in Nature Mental Health, Northeastern psychology professor Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli advises policy makers to consider turning to the low-cost, readily available practice of mindfulness meditation to change brain activity associated with mental illness.\n\"We wanted to show that lifestyle changes and behavioral interventions such as mindfulness meditation and exercise actually target the same (brain) network as quite invasive therapies such as deep brain stimulation, electroshock therapy and treatment with SSRIs,\" she says.\n\"And they do ways that typically don't have any negative side effects and are equitable in the sense that people can do them anywhere, anytime,\" says Whitfield-Gabrieli, whose EPIC Lab at Northeastern world to understand the brain basis of psychiatric disorders.\nThe adolescent mental health crisis\nThe mental health crisis is particularly acute when it comes to youth, she says.\nU.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a rare warning in December 2021 that today's young people are facing \"unprecedented\" challenges that have had a \"devastating\" effect on their mental health.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 10-year youth risk surveillance report, released in February, painted a stark picture of adolescent depression. It says that in 2021, 42% of students felt \"persistently sad or hopeless,\" and 10% had attempted suicide.\nMental Health America, a nonprofit organization, says in a 2023 publication that 16.39% of young people ages 12 to 17 reported suffering from at least one major depressive episode in the past year.\n\"Even before COVID, there was an increase in self harm and suicidal ideation,\" Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\nThat doesn't mean sufferers are getting help. Mental Health America says that in 2023, \"59.8% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment.\"\n\"Accessing therapy is very, very difficult,\" Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\nThe good news is that mindfulness meditation and exercise can make a big difference in teen mental health, she says.\nThe default mode network\nWhitfield-Gabrieli says the practices work by calming a region of the brain known as the default mode network, which was first identified via neural imaging.\nIt is \"most engaged when we're thinking about ourselves or daydreaming,\" she says, adding people can also think of it as \"mental time travel.\"\nOveractivation of the default mode network, however, may cause problems with daily functioning, Whitfield-Gabrieli says. That's when it becomes associated with decreases in executive function, negative thought patterns and, in severe cases, psychosis.\nReminiscing becomes rumination and planning for the future turns to anxiety, she says.\n\"We have a hypothesis that the overactivity or the hyper connectivity or activation of this network is specifically related to psychopathology,\" Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\nIt can lead to a \"locked in\" and \"self referential\" state of being \"where you get into repetitive, negative thinking,\" she says.\n\"It can be rehashing the past or it could be obsessively worrying about the future, but you get locked into this mode of repetitive, negative thinking.\"\nStopping the spiral of negativity\n\"The way mindfulness meditation works is it forces you to focus on the present,\" Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\nShe has used fMRI neurofeedback in her lab to illustrate the decrease in default mode network activity in teens using mindfulness meditation.\n\"We do that with teens with depression and anxiety and psychosis to help them see how they're actually modulating the networks,\" Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\nHer paper says that other treatments such as antidepressants, ketamine and transcranial magnetic stimulation also have been shown to reduce default mode network connectivity.\nBut behavioral interventions such as mindfulness meditation and exercise are of particular interest \"because they are scalable and suitable for early intervention and even prevention of mental illness in youth at measurable risk for developing psychiatric disorders,\" the article says.\n\"These are behavioral interventions people can do any time, anywhere,\" Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\nLessons for policy makers and schools\nIncreasing exercise and decreasing social media use may also help calm the default mode network associated with mental distress and are areas ripe for further study, Whitfield-Gabrieli says.\nIn the meantime, she says policy makers should consider having mindfulness meditation incorporated as part of the school day as early as preschool.\n\"We've actually done a randomized clinical trial in sixth grade charter schools that shows by doing mindfulness meditation as a regular 45-minute class that we can significantly reduce self-perceived stress.\"\n\"It's a very protective mechanism,\" she says. \"We should catch these kids before they fall.\"\nMore information: Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli et al, Tuning the default mode network with behavioral interventions to address the youth mental health crisis, Nature Mental Health (2023).

        "title": "Practicing mindfulness can help people make heart-healthy eating choices | Brown University",
        "article": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] \u2014 Practicing mindfulness focused on healthy eating can be good for the heart, a new study shows, because it improves self-awareness and helps people stick to a heart-healthy diet.\nWhen people who had elevated blood pressure participated in an eight-week mindfulness-based blood pressure reduction program for the study, they significantly improved their scores on measures of self-awareness and adherence to a heart-healthy diet compared to a control group. The results were published in JAMA Network Open.\n\u201cParticipants in the program showed significant improvement in adherence to a heart-healthy diet, which is one of the biggest drivers of blood pressure, as well as significant improvements in self-awareness, which appears to influence healthy eating habits,\u201d said lead study author Eric B. Loucks, an associate professor of epidemiology, behavioral and social sciences, and director of the Mindfulness Center at Brown University.\nLoucks said the study helps explain the mechanism by which a customized mindfulness training program adapted toward improving diet can affect blood pressure.\n\u201cImprovements in our self-awareness, of how different foods make us feel, of how our body feels in general, as well as our thoughts, emotions and physical sensations around eating healthy as well as unhealthy food, can influence people\u2019s dietary choices,\u201d he said.\nHigh blood pressure, a major cause of cardiovascular disease, is the single most important risk factor for early death worldwide, according to a recent report by the World Health Organization, leading to an estimated 10.8 million avoidable deaths every year. The important thing to note about those avoidable deaths, Loucks said, is that there is ample research supporting effective strategies to control and prevent hypertension.\n\u201cAlmost everyone has the power to control blood pressure through changes in diet and physical activity, adherence to antihypertensive medications, minimizing alcohol intake and monitoring stress reactivity,\u201d he said.\nA heart-focused mindfulness program\nThe mindfulness-based blood pressure reduction program used in the study, which Loucks developed in 2014, trains participants in skills such as meditation, yoga, self-awareness, attention control and emotion regulation. What makes the program unique, he said, is that participants learn how to direct those skills toward behaviors known to lower blood pressure.\nThe MB-BP plan consisted of a group orientation session, eight 2.5-hour weekly group sessions and one day-long retreat, as well as recommended home practice for 45 minutes, six days a week. The program was led by trained instructors with expertise in cardiovascular disease etiology, treatment and prevention. Classes were held in Providence, R.I., at Brown University and at a health center in a lower-income, urban neighborhood.\nThe study compared two groups, totaling 201 participants. The 101 people in the test group were a part of the 8-week MB-BP program, which included personalized feedback and education about hypertension risk factors; mindfulness training of participants in relationship to hypertension risk factors (including mindful eating); and behavior change support. The \u201cusual care\u201d control group received educational brochures on controlling high blood pressure. Both groups received a home blood-pressure monitoring device with usage training, and options for referral to primary care physicians.\nThe researchers focused on participant adherence to the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) program, a balanced eating plan rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy, intended to create a heart-healthy eating style for life. Despite its effectiveness, adherence to the DASH diet is typically low.\nAfter six months, the mindfulness group showed a 0.34-point improvement in the DASH diet score. Loucks explained that this effect can be interpreted as equivalent for a participant shifting from a vegetable intake approaching recommended levels (2-3 servings) to recommended levels (at least 4 servings), or making similar shifts across another component of the DASH score. The control group showed a -0.04-point change in DASH diet score.\nThe mindfulness group also showed a 0.71-point improvement in the average interoceptive awareness (which is the process of sensing and interpreting signals from one's own body) score compared to six months prior, which outperformed the control group by a significant 0.54 points.\nThe authors said the trial results offer evidence that an adapted mindfulness training program for participants with high blood pressure that targets diet and self-awareness significantly improves both.\n\u201cThe program gives participants the tools to make heart-healthy diet changes that can lower their blood pressure and decrease their risk of cardiovascular disease,\u201d Loucks said.\nThe researchers are studying different \u201cdoses\u201d of the program (for example, shorter program lengths, fewer sessions), as well as factors influencing the implementation of the MB-BP plan in a real-world setting \u2014 including eligibility for health insurance coverage, accessibility for different patient groups and flexibility for physicians.\nAdditional contributors from Brown University included Frances Saadeh, Matthew Scarpaci, Jeffrey Proulx, Roee Gutman and Willoughby Britton. The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health Science of Behavior Change Common Fund Program through an award administered by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (UH2AT009145, UH3AT009145).",

(KION-TV): In late October, shoppers at the DD's Discount Store in Salinas were asked to leave the building because investigators said 50-year-old Fernando Lupian Rivas entered the store saying he had been stabbed.\nRivas later died and 36-year-old Jose Velasco was arrested and charged with the crime. Velasco has since pleaded not gulity to first-degree murder.\nThe mother of Velasco, Rita Acosta, said her son has gone through mental health problems for years.\n\"He was five years old when we realized he was hearing and talking to the voices,\" said Acosta. \"I used to watch him through the window, I thought he had an imaginary friend, he burnt my bedroom in my house.\"\nAcosta said Velasco has been in and out of jail. He was involved in a police brutality case in 2015 and also accused of robbing a taco truck.\nWhen he got released from prison, Acosta said her son still needed help. She said she tried putting her son in a local psychiatric unit two weeks before the deadly stabbing, but he was released after a few days.\n\"Like omg they sent him back? I started calling again mental health,\" said Acosta. \"Behavioral health, I said my son just got out of the psych unit, and he is not well, they took him in and did an evaluation on him, but they sent him back, \"How do they know what, well, good is for him?\"\nAcosta said her son was in the psychiatric unit at Natividad Medical Center for 3 days. Under California's 5150 law if someone cannot provide food, clothing, and shelter and is experiencing a mental health crisis, they can only stay at a hospital for up to 72 hours.\nKathryn Eckert with the Monterey County Behavioral Health Department said that needs to change.\n\"Yes, it does need to be funded.\" said Eckert, Monterey County Behavioral Health, Bureau Chief.\n\"I think it's much more critically important that we build support and structure embedded in our communities to help our communities,\" said Eckert. \"Our neighbors, our friends, our families thrive within our community.\"\nEckert said for that reason, the County of Monterey is working to provide more services.\n\"We are working right now at converting the old jail into a mental health rehabilitation center\" said Eckert. Eckert said the center would allow people who came out of a mental health unit, to stay there in a locked setting while they're trying to get them stabilized to get them back in the community.\nMonterey County Behavioral Health received a 20-million dollar grant from the state.",

Participants were also encouraged to practice at home for 45 minutes, six days a week.\nThe goal of the intervention was to provide a foundation of mindfulness skills such as meditation, yoga, self-awareness, attention control, and emotion regulation, and then have participants use those skills to follow the DASH diet.\nWhat Is the DASH Diet?\nThe DASH diet is designed to help improve blood pressure by limiting salt and focusing on foods high in calcium, potassium, magnesium, and fiber \u2014 which, when combined, help lower blood pressure, according to MedlinePlus.\nNonstarchy vegetables and fruit are a primary focus, which includes things like green beans, asparagus, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, kale, sugar snap peas, and squash. The diet also includes moderate amounts of:\n- fat-free or low-fat dairy products\n- whole grains\n- lean meats and poultry\n- beans, soy foods, and legumes\n- eggs and egg substitutes\n- fish\n- nuts and seeds\n- heart-healthy fats, such as olive and canola oil or avocados\nIn the DASH diet, sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages, foods high in saturated fats such as full-fat dairy, fatty meals, fried foods, tropical oils, most packaged snacks, and alcohol should be limited or avoided.\nAt least 30 minutes of exercise a day most days of the week (adding up to at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per week of activities) at a moderate-intensity level is also part of the DASH lifestyle. To help prevent weight gain, 60 minutes of daily exercise is recommended.\nIn addition to lowering blood pressure, research suggests that following the DASH diet may reduce the risk for heart disease, heart failure, and stroke, prevent or control type 2 diabetes, improve cholesterol levels, and reduce the chance of kidney stones.\nThe \u201cusual care\u201d control group received educational brochures on controlling high blood pressure. Both groups received a home blood-pressure monitoring device with usage training, and options for referral to primary care physicians.\nMindfulness Group Improved Self Awareness and Their Eating Habits\nAfter six months, the mindfulness group showed a 0.34-point increase in the DASH diet score. For example, a person who would usually eat two or three servings of vegetables a day increased that amount to at least four servings \u2014 which is the recommended level, according to the authors. The control group showed a 0.04-point decrease in their DASH diet score.\nThe mindfulness group also showed a 0.71-point improvement in the average interoceptive awareness score (which measures the process of sensing and interpreting signals from one's own body) compared with six months prior, which outperformed the control group by a significant 0.54 points.\nThe study helps explain the mechanism by which a customized mindfulness training program adapted toward improving diet can affect blood pressure, says Loucks.\n\u201cImprovements in our self-awareness, of how different foods make us feel, of how our body feels in general, as well as our thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations around eating healthy as well as unhealthy food, can influence people\u2019s dietary choices,\u201d he says.\nThe findings also provide further support for mindfulness interventions, including research published in May 2023 in the Journal of the American Heart Association by Loucks and colleagues that showed similar programs can help lower systolic blood pressure.\nHow Mindfulness Can Help Shift Eating Patterns\nMindfulness is defined as the awareness that comes from observing your own internal and external state in the present moment in a nonjudgmental way. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a method for reducing physical and psychological suffering while building resilience, balance, and peace of mind, according to the Brown School of Public Health.\nHow can this be applied to change how we eat? A framework for how mindfulness training could influence dietary patterns is emerging through research, and it includes three domains: self-awareness, attention control, and emotion regulation, says Loucks.\nSelf-Awareness could influence dietary behaviors, including noticing hunger and fullness, noticing how different food types make us feel, and being aware of our eating behaviors, including our habits and what rewards and harms we receive from eating the way we typically do.\nAttention Control can be applied to dietary behaviors by being present with the sensory properties of food (like taste, smell, and how it looks), making conscious choices for healthy eating patterns and against possibly unconscious unhealthy eating patterns, and shopping for specific foods that are better for our health.\nEmotion Regulation can be applied to dietary behaviors in ways like lowering our reactivity to food cravings, self-kindness and compassion for our body and mind, and lowering our psychological distress, which can undermine efforts to stick to healthy dietary patterns that we know deep inside we'd like to follow.\nEveryday Health follows strict sourcing guidelines to ensure the accuracy of its content, outlined in our editorial policy.

        "article": "This story is featured in CityBeat's May 17 print edition.\nSea creatures have made their way to Ohio this spring and summer via the Lloyd Library and Museum\u2019s exhibit The Mighty Deep: An Exploration of Sea Life. The carefully-curated exhibit features ichthyology illustrations and records of various fish, shells, crustaceans, algae, seaweed and kelp.\nWalk into the Lloyd and you\u2019ll likely notice the exhibit\u2019s banner, just outside the adjacent gallery. On it reads a quote by nature writer and marine biologist Rachel Carson: \u201cThe sea has always challenged the minds and imagination of men and even today it remains the last great frontier of earth.\u201d\nThe Mighty Deep, which runs through July 28, unearths treasures from the Lloyd Library\u2019s collection that explore coastal environments, aquatic life and pharmaceutical marine plants. The adjacent gallery features larger, vibrant prints of a loggerhead turtle, land crab, angel fish, flying fish, rudderfish and freshwater perch. Each print in the adjacent gallery was pulled from 18th-century naturalist Mark Catesby\u2019s The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands.\nBut there\u2019s just as much to explore in Midwestern waterways and natural habitats. Museumgoers can enjoy programs throughout the exhibit\u2019s run, including \u201cGroundwork: Where Justice and the Environment Meet,\" which is held on May 25 at 7 p.m. The event will feature Groundwork Ohio River Valley's Jaeydah Edwards and Luis Aguilar, who will discuss the environmental nonprofit's initiatives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really rewarding to work with the youth and residents to talk about water quality and what\u2019s going on in their backyards, essentially,\u201d says Edwards, who serves as Groundwork\u2019s citizen science program director. \u201cWe\u2019re in one big watershed and what everybody does affects not only Cincinnati, but it\u2019s going into the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico.\u201d\nGroundwork has three goals, as stated on their website: \u201cPursue a future in which everyone\u2019s neighborhood environment is green, healthy and resilient; undo legacies of poverty and racial discrimination; break the trend of widening disparity between communities that are enjoying a renaissance and communities that are experiencing disinvestment, neglect and deepening poverty.\u201d\nGroundwork has various on-the-ground initiatives to meet those goals. One of them is the Green Team: a program that works with local high school students to help them better understand the environment, learn green industry job skills and improve various spaces in Greater Cincinnati.\nRelated\nGoing Green(er): Cincinnati Researchers are Focusing on the Climate Challenges that Intimately Affect Residents: Cincinnati is one of 23 (and counting) urban cities across North America that have publicly committed to reducing energy consumption, water use and transportation emissions by at least 50% before scientists say it\u2019s too late.\nAguilar, who directs the Green Team, says they equip students to do conservation work with other community organizations. Many of the programs are year-round, except for winter. This year, they\u2019re aiming to have 80 to 90 kids working with them on everything from invasive species removal to restoration work to air and water quality projects.\nAguilar doesn\u2019t expect everyone who goes through the Green Team to leave as environmental scientists but rather to have a working knowledge of topics and issues facing their communities.\n\u201cFor the kids that come in from these communities, they are vulnerable. Sometimes they\u2019ll come in and they want to do the program and they\u2019re supporting their families, in a way,\u201d says Aguilar. \u201cMy goal is to make sure that, yes, this is a job. But when they exit the program, I want them to be more informed citizens for Cincinnati.\u201d\nAt the Lloyd Library event, Edwards says they plan to give a deep dive into the organization as a whole and its various programs, including Citizen Science, Green Team and Climate Safe Neighborhoods. The latter looks at the relationship between the city\u2019s history of redlining \u2013\u2013 meaning the practice of race-based housing segregation \u2013\u2013 and the current (and predicted) impact of the climate crisis on those neighborhoods.\n\u201cThe climate crisis is more severe in certain neighborhoods,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cFor example, Lower Price Hill has the lowest tree canopy coverage in the whole city of Cincinnati. Less tree canopy coverage makes it hotter, so it\u2019s increasing the urban heat-island effect.\u201d\nBeyond finding the why, Edwards adds that they also help residents build and apply resiliency plans to fight the climate crisis; in doing so, those living within neighborhoods can voice what they want to see in their community, whether that be planting street trees, adding misting stations at bus stops or a green roof.\n\u201cPeople know what they want to see in their neighborhoods and they know what they want to see to make a change,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cBut there\u2019s a disconnect on how to make it happen. It\u2019s very important, in my opinion, to let people know that their opinions and their voices are important and to empower them to have their voices heard.\u201d\nAs for Citizen Science, Edwards says the program works with businesses, residents and the Green Team to monitor air quality. In Lower Price Hill, they placed monitors in both residential and industrial parts of the community, as well as in and outside of homes, to compare levels at different sections. According to Edwards, the program has only grown from there.\nCitizen Science also has water quality programs. Green Teamers get to perform macroinvertebrate testing. Some macroinvertebrate organisms \u2013\u2013 critters like mayflies, dragonflies, crayfish and snails \u2013\u2013 are more sensitive to pollution than others. In water quality testing, their presence (or lack thereof) can indicate how polluted (or \u201cclean\u201d) any given stream site may be.\nAt the talk, the duo will also cover Groundwork\u2019s partnership with the Miami Conservancy, in which they go out in the summer and collect data from four locations along the river.\nWhen speaking on the preservation of waterways here in Ohio, Aguilar says the historical context of what water sources were like pre- and post-industrialization is important. But they also ask: What can we do now? This year, Aguilar says they plan to amp up the water quality aspect of their program, immersing youth even more into the work.\n\u201cWhere we come in is not to scare our audience, not to push them away from it, but to involve them,\u201d says Aguilar. \u201cI think the significance of our Citizen Science program \u2013\u2013 that Jaeydah is operating \u2013\u2013 is that it provides an opportunity for them to engage at a fundamental state.\u201d\n\u201cGroundwork: Where Justice and the Environment Meet\u201d will be held at 7 p.m. on May 25 at Lloyd Library, 917 Plum Street, Downtown.

        "article": "Environmental Justice & Anti-racism in Science, Hosted by Mt Sinai Precision Environmental Health in Cincinnati\nReprinted from the NIEHS Environmental Factor.\nTwo NIEHS-funded research centers, known as \u201cCore Centers,\u201d sponsored community forums in May, giving scientists and health advocates an opportunity to showcase their work and to discuss important and emerging topics with NIEHS leaders.\nNIEHS and National Toxicology Program (NTP) Director Rick Woychik, Ph.D., led a discussion on precision environmental health during his visit with the University of Cincinnati (UC) Center for Environmental Genetics (CEG) on May 10. NIEHS Deputy Director Trevor Archer, Ph.D., gave a keynote presentation on addressing anti-racism in science as part of a virtual event hosted May 18 by the Mount Sinai Center on Health and Environment Across the LifeSpan (HEALS).\nPrecision environmental health\n\u201cPrecision environmental health is a framework for understanding how environmental exposures throughout the life course can interact with an individual\u2019s unique genetic, epigenetic, and biological makeup and influence later-life health outcomes,\u201d noted Woychik.\n\u201cTo help prevent disease in Cincinnati and beyond, researchers must work to better understand gene-environment interactions and the corresponding biological changes that can result,\u201d he said.\nDuring his visit, three early-career scientists from UC shared their gene-environment research.\n- Katherine Burns, Ph.D., discussed endocrine disruptors and endometriosis.\n- Senu Apewokin, M.D., focused on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and pneumococcal vaccination response.\n- Angelico Mendy, M.D., Ph.D., presented research on air pollution and COVID-19.\n\u201cI really enjoyed meeting the investigators behind the work that we support at the University of Cincinnati,\u201d said Woychik. \u201cThey will help drive the future of environmental health sciences.\u201d\nNIEHS funded $15.5 million in research studies at universities across Ohio last year.\nInspired by community members\nWoychik also toured Cincinnati and listened to community leaders discuss their efforts to reduce air pollution and address concerns about lack of clean water.\nClimate resilience and citizen science efforts were among the topics discussed by leaders of Groundwork Ohio River Valley. Other presentations featured representatives from Urban Health Pathway and the Center for Closing the Health Gap.\n\u201cI was really inspired by the community member presentations,\u201d said Woychik. \u201cVisiting the neighborhoods and talking with residents reinforces the important role that community engagement plays in helping us achieve our mission at NIEHS.\u201d\nWoychik\u2019s hosts were Andrew Filak, Jr., M.D., dean of the College of Medicine, George Leikauf, Ph.D., Department of Environmental and Public Health Sciences (DEPHS) chair and professor, and CEG Director Susan Pinney, Ph.D.\nInclusivity in the scientific workforce\nAnti-racism and environmental justice were among the featured topics of the second community forum. The online event was hosted by Luz Guel and Maida Galvez, M.D., from HEALS, which is an NIEHS-funded core center at the Institute for Exposomic Research in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which is in New York City.\nArcher was one of three featured speakers. He shared information about NIEHS and National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiatives to address racial disparities in biomedical research and advance environmental justice, including the following.\n- The UNITE Initiative was created to identify and address structural racism across NIH.\n- Research to Action (R2A) projects include at least one environmental health sciences researcher and a community-based organization to bring public health action plans to communities. Currently, 14 R2A teams are addressing community environmental health issues such as tribal exposures, climate change and community resilience, and more.\n\u201cGreater inclusivity in the scientific workforce will promote innovation at NIH and across the biomedical research community,\u201d said Archer. \u201cAnd at NIEHS, increased community engagement will help to ensure that our work informs the health decisions of individuals who often are disproportionately affected by environmental exposures.\u201d\nRacism as an environmental public health issue\nArcher also shared information about recent workshops hosted by the NIEHS Environmental Health Disparities and Environmental Justice (EHD-EJ) Faculty. Members helped to organize two major events, including one addressing racism as an environmental public health issue and another focused on disparities in women\u2019s reproductive health.\n\u201cThis faculty really is an attempt within NIEHS to draw attention to the science behind health disparities and provide action steps for researchers and impacted communities,\u201d he said.\nArcher also announced that the next NIEHS-supported Environmental Justice Boot Camp will be held August 15-16.\nAddressing environmental and climate injustices and exploring racism as a social determinant of health were among the topics discussed by Almetta Pitts and Sacoby Wilson, Ph.D., who also were featured speakers at the May 18 event. Wilson provided an historical overview of scientific racism and environmental justice.\nJohn Schelp, NIEHS special assistant for community engagement and outreach, and Liam O\u2019Fallon, health specialist in the institute\u2019s Population Health Branch, helped to organize these and other NIEHS community forums, and they contributed to this article.\n(Jennifer Harker, Ph.D., is a technical writer-editor in the NIEHS Office of Communications and Public Liaison.)",

        "article": "EPA grant will pay Cincinnati residents to measure pollution\nNeighborhoods along Beekman Street in Cincinnati \u2014 and a number of other communities \u2014 have experienced decades of air pollution from nearby highways and industry. But a new grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded to local nonprofit Groundwork Ohio River Valley will pay residents in those places to measure that pollution in an effort to find solutions.\nAbout $200,000 of the $482,000 grant will go directly to paying participants in North Fairmount, South Cumminsville, Millvale, Roselawn, Bond Hill and other neighborhoods. Participants will also include members of Groundwork's youth jobs program. The rest of the funds will be used to purchase equipment and provide training on how to use it.\nGroundwork Citizen Science Program Manager Jaeydah Edwards says the effort is allied with a larger program \u2014 Climate Advisory Groups\u2014 that seeks to put members of communities experiencing environmental disparities in the driver's seat when it comes to finding solutions.\nFinding solutions to longstanding problems\nDecades of industrial activity and highway traffic have caused environmental damage in low-income Cincinnati communities like those in the Beekman Corridor. Due to a history of racist government policies and market dynamics, many of the residents there are people of color. The communities have lower-than-average life expectancies and higher levels of health conditions associated with pollution. The people who live in those places are often concerned about the impact that pollution is having on their health, Edwards says.\n\"In a lot of these neighborhoods, residents mentioned that they were concerned about the quality of the air,\" she says. \"We wanted to form these programs to improve the air quality there.\"\nEdwards says the data could be used to determine where more tree cover should be planted, as well as where there are opportunities for other air quality improvement measures. Eventually, Groundwork aims to publish the data in an online dashboard that shows air quality across the participating neighborhoods.\nThe program is already going in Lower Price Hill, where 10 residents are currently measuring air quality. The residents come to meetings where they get training on how to use two varieties of air quality monitors. Participants then go out into their communities \u2014 and even into their own homes \u2014 to measure air pollution levels. At the end of the week, they come back with the monitors, turn in their data, and receive a check compensating them for their work.\nEdwards says Groundwork is aiming to pay 50 residents to do the air quality monitoring across all the participating neighborhoods.",

        "article": "Vitis Technologies Establishes IT Headquarters and Technology Hub in Newly Renovated Design Center in Blue Ash, Ohio\nCINCINNATI, Feb. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prosource, a business technology solutions provider headquartered in Blue Ash, Ohio, announced today that its managed services division, Prosource Technologies, is rebranding to Vitis Technologies. Vitis offers managed IT and cybersecurity solutions that protect, power, and connect organizations.\nBen Russert, CEO of Prosource, said, \"We have always prioritized anticipating what's ahead so our clients are prepared, and that's been a key differentiator for us in the market. We practice what we preach, so we've been investing in the ever-evolving technology space to prepare our business for what's next, too. Launching Vitis Technologies is the necessary next step as we expand and enhance our ability to help clients operate more efficiently, effectively, and securely.\"\nThe name, Vitis, has a Latin origin meaning grapevine and represents the way an IT network integrates every element of a company's ecosystem.\nJeff Loeb, President of Vitis Technologies, said \"Since the inception of our managed IT services division in 2013, Prosource Technologies has successfully grown into one of the leading managed services providers (MSP) in the region. The strategic decision to rebrand as Vitis Technologies signifies our commitment to advancing our established Prosource brand reputation in office equipment, while simultaneously establishing a new identity known for delivering best-in-class managed IT services. This transformation reflects our dedication to maintaining excellence and innovation across both brands.\"\nProsource has also relocated the Technologies division from offices in West Chester into the newly renovated Design Center building in Blue Ash (visible from I-71). They intentionally chose to bring 75 highly skilled team members to this Blue Ash location to be more centrally located in Greater Cincinnati. They're just down the road from Prosource's headquarters, where a large number of their 250 employees also work in the city they've called home for 35 years.\nAs a Prosource company, Vitis Technologies shares Prosource's values of delivering a stellar customer experience and working in partnership with clients. To encourage in-person collaboration among team members and with clients, the new headquarters has been designed to serve as a technology hub\u2014offering a tech-enabled space to be used by team members, clients, partners, and the community. Cincinnati's tech industry continues to grow, and the Vitis tech hub offers new opportunities for collective innovation.\nBenny Russert, Director of Technology Alignment, said \"As we set out to create a space that would reflect our unique culture, we took into account several factors that would enhance collaboration and innovation not only across our teams but also with our clients. We designed the facility to promote foot traffic across team members and working groups that wouldn't typically engage on a day-to-day basis. We also engaged various local partners to make the space a great place to work, capturing the energy that a tech company like ours harnesses to drive a great culture and attract the best talent.\"\nThis move is the next step in Prosource's strategic growth and commitment to client service amid a rapidly changing technology landscape. In January 2023, Prosource acquired Prospera Solutions Group, a managed IT services provider located in Fort Wright, Kentucky. This acquisition\u2014one of two by Prosource last year\u2014expanded Prosource's physical footprint, adding a Northern Kentucky office, and increased the Technologies division's capacity and capabilities to help clients leverage technology for strategic advantage.\nThe new technology-focused headquarters further solidifies Vitis Technologies' position as a leading MSP and trusted IT partner in the Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region.\nAbout Prosource\nProsource is the Midwest region's leading business technology solutions provider with headquarters in Blue Ash, Ohio. Founded in 1985, Prosource has evolved from a printer and copier company into a complete business technology solutions provider with more than 240 employees in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Technology and business never stop moving and neither does Prosource.

        "title": "Isaac Hamlin, Shaking Things up One Smoothie at a Time",
        "article": "Isaac Hamlin, Shaking Things up One Smoothie at a Time\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / September 5, 2020 / Two years ago, Isaac Hamlin graduated from the University of Kentucky with a business management degree and a desire to make the world a happier, healthier place. The ink on his diploma had barely dried when he decided to found Better Blend Nutrition.\nBetter Blend Nutrition is a healthy smoothie shop that specializes in healthy alternatives. The flagship line of smoothies, \"The Blends,\" are low in calories, fat, carbs, and sugar, fortified with vitamins and minerals, and don't miss out on flavor. Whether used as a meal replacement or a healthy treat, The Blends are a great, novel option for busy people looking for something nutritious, delicious, filling and fast. Better Blend Nutrition's menu continues to expand to provide more options to fit every lifestyle.\nIsaac developed the idea while he was still at UK, playing second row on UK's rugby team. As a college athlete, Isaac knew how hard it was to find quality fuel that wouldn't weigh him down, bust his diet, and still tasted good. Although he knew what he wanted to do, many entrepreneurs face challenges, and Isaac was no exception. In the beginning, he had trouble securing funding from investors. To overcome that obstacle, Isaac maxed out a dozen credit cards, recruited his family, and got to work building the shop himself.\nAnother challenge Isaac faced was penetrating the market. The health and fitness industry has exploded with many products over the past decades, so Isaac had to find a way to stand out from the crowd. One aspect he focused on was brand culture. Isaac believes the culture of Better Blend Nutrition has been just as crucial to its success as the excellent products it offers.\nInfluenced by the tenet of teamwork he discovered in rugby, Isaac first began cultivating that culture bringing on board people who were passionate about the brand and each guest. This created a warm, inclusive atmosphere that was infectious. Since then, Isaac's continued to work hard to keep the feeling of camaraderie going, striving to create with Better Blend Nutrition something that makes people feel happy, valued, and a part of something bigger. He says this starts behind the bar but extends to guests and the community as a whole.\nSince its inception, Better Blend Nutrition has been very well received by the local community and has seen substantial success. Isaac says that while pursuing a startup company right out of college was challenging, he feels lucky to have the opportunity to pursue his passion and is filled with gratitude for the outpour of support from friends and family. He suggests that an entrepreneur's perception of fear and success is crucial to the trajectory of their business-and for Isaac, his idea of success is the opportunity to apply his talents to making the world a better place. He doesn't let fear hold him back.\nFueled by passion, Isaac plans to move forward by expanding Better Blend Nutrition nationwide and creating a line of Blends to be shipped directly to the consumer. For starters, Isaac is opening two new locations in the next six months in the Cincinnati, Ohio area.

They came up with the name Peachy and Vintage as homage to 1970s Just Peachy graphics.\n\u201cBefore we opened Pike Street, we started doing markets and kind of got our name out there,\u201d Adams said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when we realized that our customers wanted to have a place to try stuff on in a permanent location instead of just shopping online.\u201d\nThey didn\u2019t want to apply for business loans \u2014 they already had student loan debt \u2014 so they entered the Kentucky Pitch competition at NKU and won $7,000. The duo went through a three-month NKU incubator program and learned more about running a business, like how to develop a business model. They\u2019re a part of NKU\u2019s women entrepreneurial group, and Covington\u2019s Small Business Incentive Program helps with their rent.\nBrick-and-mortar retail is having a comeback moment in 2023, both in Covington and beyond.\nAccording to Macy\u2019s CEO Jeff Gennette, \u201c60% of the U.S. brick-and-mortar retail is conducted outside malls.\u201d\nOccupancy rates have increased in malls as well, though, with Simon Property Group, the largest mall owner in the U.S., reporting a near 95% occupancy rate for 2022.\nAt the same time Peachy and Vintage was staking its claim on Pike Street, another women-owned business, Pink Moon, opened less than a block away at 621 Madison Ave.; their other location is at Newport on the Levee.\nPink Moon sells crystals, Tarot cards, horror movie apparel and lingerie. They also host Tarot readings and events, like a recent live podcast with Coven of Screams.\nLast year, Pink Moon co-owner Holly Nicole told LINK nky she feels in-person retail will always have an appeal that online shopping can\u2019t replicate.\n\u201cI feel that in the fashion end here, there isn\u2019t as much,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk into a store in the mall and pick out something that you see on TV or the internet and things like that. I know that online shopping is so big, but we do still love to go in and see something and touch it.\u201d\nBraden noted shopping for apparel at a mall usually means supporting the \u201cfast fashion\u201d industry \u2013 a term that refers to mass-manufactured clothing that is traded in for the next trend and often ends up in landfills.\n\u201cSustainability in the fast fashion industry is something that we\u2019ve learned a lot about and its impacts socially on the people making the clothes in the environment,\u201d Braden said. \u201cI think being more connected with our customers also helps us to really tell them they\u2019re keeping clothing out of the landfill. Vintage clothing used to be made so much better than clothing now, so it\u2019s actually made to last and not just be worn a couple times and thrown away.\u201d\nBraden emphasized how garment workers in developing nations like Bangladesh make less than a dollar a day and work in unsafe conditions. Many companies in fast fashion greenwash, or say they\u2019re practicing sustainability but are actually polluting the environment, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice for people to put their hands on the clothing and actually feel the difference between fast fashion,\u201d Braden said.\nOn a regular basis Peachy throws events, like the monthly Sip and Thrift, in which customers can drink free wine and get a discount on merchandise. In February, they threw a Galentine\u2019s Day party with Pink Moon and other women-owned businesses.\n\u201cWe really wanted to be a space where people could come together,\u201d Braden said. \u201cWe\u2019re really passionate about helping other small businesses, which is why we have a lot of consignment artists. They\u2019re people who don\u2019t have time to own their own store and to set up markets, but they have their pieces in here. We are able to send them money when their stuff sells,\u201d\nBoth Pink Moon and Peachy bring their millennial and Gen Z vibes to the storefronts. They\u2019re both active on Instagram, and Peachy has an Instagrammable backdrop with a ring light, which they use to photograph their wares, but also use for events. Peachy has a classic look, but it\u2019s not your traditional vintage store. Plus, it\u2019s the only one located in Covington\u2019s central business district.\nIn May, they\u2019re hosting a fashion show at Madison Live and it may be their biggest event yet.\nDespite having so much immediate success, sometimes people don\u2019t take them seriously because of their age.\n\u201cPeople assume we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing, or we\u2019re not doing things right,\u201d Braden said. \u201cBut I also think there\u2019s a lot of great people. We had a customer who was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know you, but I\u2019m so proud of you.\u2019\u201d\nBraden\u2019s dad owns a business, which inspired her to start Peachy. He designed their logo and van, and put together the clothing racks. However, Adams\u2019s grandfather and father haven\u2019t quite been as supportive.\n\u201cThey wanted me to take a more traditional career path,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI think a lot of it is the fact that I am a woman and they weren\u2019t really confident in my abilities or our abilities, but I feel like we\u2019ve been proving them wrong.\u201d\nThe pair said being a women-owned business has its challenges, but women have to stick together.\n\u201cThere are people who definitely treat us differently because we are women,\u201d Adams said. \u201cOlder men come in and they ask us questions and want to give us their advice, which we appreciate, but we can feel the difference. If we were two men, we would not be treated the same way.\u201d\n\u201cI love to see the growth of women-owned businesses, and I think that we\u2019ve gotten a lot of support for being women owned,\u201d Braden added.\n\u201cWe like to label ourselves as a women\u2019s business, and we like to tell everybody because I do think it is an empowering statement,\u201d Nicole said.\nPeachy\u2019s five-year plan includes maybe owning a storefront or having a warehouse space for inventory. They\u2019d like to have a direct-to-garment printer, and they\u2019re getting into embroidery. They want to be more event-focused, hire employees, and travel to source items.\n\u201cWe like being a part of the community, personally, and Covington\u2019s up and coming,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThere\u2019s a million reasons that people should come to Covington, and we love that we are one-of-a-kind here.\u201d",

        "title": "Greenhouse Caf\u00e9 in Lebanon places emphasis on local sourcing",
        "article": "The farm-to-table movement has gained a lot of traction around the world in recent years, and Southwest Ohio is no exception. One of many such restaurants, the Greenhouse Caf\u00e9 in Lebanon, is committed to bringing healthy, local food to the Cincinnati area and accommodating a wide variety of people.\nGreenhouse Caf\u00e9 has been open since 2019, but current owner Sam Heareth bought it from founder Lindsay Mescher in March of this year. Heareth had always dreamed of owning a restaurant. The Lebanon native had been to culinary school and started her own business teaching cooking classes at Liberty Farm Market.\nAs with many business owners, Heareth had to pivot when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. She opened a farm-to-table food truck called Grassroots Kitchen, which she gave up to buy the Greenhouse Caf\u00e9 and achieve her lifelong dream. \u201c\nI could possibly see it making a reemergence in the future, though,\u201d Heareth said of the Grassroots Kitchen.\nGreenhouse Caf\u00e9 sells sandwiches, salads, quinoa bowls, tea, kombucha on tap, coffee, craft cocktails, and local beer and wine. Emphasis is placed on locally-sourced, organic ingredients.\n\u201cWhat makes Greenhouse Caf\u00e9 unique is it truly has something for everyone,\u201d Heareth said. \u201cWe cater to many dietary preferences and allergies and provide a place where people can feel good eating at. We pride ourselves on our use of local fresh ingredients and making as much as we possibly can in-house.\u201d\nAll sauces are vegan, soy-free, and gluten-free, and many dishes either already are or can be made vegetarian or vegan. Some unique offerings include a chamomile CBD elixir and a cashew cold brew.\nGreenhouse Caf\u00e9 also offers a small bites menu, which is available from Thursdays to Saturdays in the evenings.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had long-lasting effects on small businesses, and for Greenhouse, the biggest impact is the rising cost of ingredients, which is compounded when buying local ingredients. This has caused Heareth to raise prices, which some customers are not happy about. However, Greenhouse Caf\u00e9 has a wide net of support.\n\u201cI have an absolutely amazing team that works for me. Everyone works so well together and supports one another,\u201d Heareth said. \u201cOne of the other awesome things about it is the feeling of the support of the local small businesses in the Lebanon community. Our customers are amazing and really appreciate Greenhouse Caf\u00e9's mission of supplying fresh sustainable food.\u201d\nHeareth\u2019s upcoming plan is to remodel the kitchen to expand the menu offerings, such as more dinner items. Heareth would also like to add brunch on the weekends. One possibility is to open a secondary location and bring the fresh, sustainable offerings to a wider audience.\nHow to go\nWhat: Greenhouse Caf\u00e9\nWhere: 105 E. Mulberry St. in Lebanon\nHours: 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Thursdays, 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Fridays and 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Sundays. Closed Mondays.\nAbout the Author",

After quickly outgrowing that first space, they moved to the 2,500 square foot shop in the Greater Cincinnati area where their company, Peachy and Vintage, currently operates. The duo placed second in the KY Pitch competition in 2022 and were recognized as Cincy Inno 5 Under 25 winners in 2023.\nEmil Barr\n21 | Founder, Step Up Social\nLike many startups, Step Up Social was founded in Emil Barr\u2019s college dorm room in 2021.

        "title": "MD Student Support and Diversity: Chantal Phillips | Temerty Faculty of Medicine",
        "article": "Second-year medical student Chantal Phillips says as a kid she didn\u2019t realize she was growing up in poverty.\nWhile visiting her stepfamily, she met kids who had the opportunity of becoming doctors \u2014 something she felt was out of reach for her. Phillips credits programs like the Faculty of Medicine\u2019s Community of Support and Black Student Application Program \u2014 as well as student financial support \u2014 in making opportunities like these possible.\n\u201cNow, I am the first in my family to go to university, and will be the first to be a doctor,\u201d she says.\nAs the Faculty of Medicine works to support students from diverse backgrounds through various programs, including providing matching funding for donations to MD student bursaries, in the following Q&A excerpt, Chantal reflects on her own journey to medical school.\nWhat inspired your interest in medicine?\nMy mother was a personal support worker (PSW) throughout my childhood and it was clear how much she cared for her patients. Having her as an example of what an empathetic health care provider looked like gave me insight and sparked my desire to emulate that in my own career.\nAt the systemic level, my interest in addressing health disparities in the black community was a major propelling factor. Overall, I knew being a doctor would help merge my desire to positively and directly impact lives, while also influencing social systems that have downstream effects on the morbidity and mortality of Black Canadians.\nDid you know many Black health care professionals before applying to med school?\nMost of the Black health care professionals I encountered were PSWs or nurses. I\u2019d never been treated by a Black physician, despite living in Toronto and then Brampton, which have substantial Black populations.\nWhy do you think Black students have been under-represented in medicine?\nThe nature of privilege and education is multifaceted. Getting into medical school doesn\u2019t start with the application cycle. It starts the moment we\u2019re born and become learners. Black communities experience higher rates of poverty, which influences access to educational resources.\nChildren from families of higher socioeconomic status typically have parents with the means to support educational activities. Academic summer camps, time at the library, tutors and early mentorship are examples of privileges that establish a foundation for learning and advancement.\nFurthermore, underrepresentation is cyclical. When you don\u2019t see people who look like you represented in a particular field, especially a competitive one, it can have a negative impact on your self-image and self-efficacy.\nRead the full Q&A with Chantal Phillips, and find out more about the Faculty of Medicine\u2019s Black Student Application Program (BSAP)\nHow did Faculty of Medicine\u2019s Black Student Application Program help you get to know U of T Medicine better, and help U of T Medicine get to know you better?\nThe Black Student Application Program reinforces the advocacy, diversity and inclusion outlined in the U of T Medicine strategic plan. It\u2019s one thing to read a strategic plan and another to see measurable action of these documents. Investing in this stream to address an evident disparity emphasized the authenticity of these claims. Applying through this stream also allowed me to more genuinely speak about my involvement in the Black community. I was confident these initiatives would be appreciated for their full value, considering there were Black community members reviewing the applications.\nHow was your experience during the first term of the MD Program?\nMy initial transition to medical school wasn\u2019t easy. Uprooting and rebuilding your home, academic standing, social circle and community initiatives would be tumultuous for practically anyone. I got really sick at the beginning of flu season because of how much stress I was putting myself under. It was a wake-up call and made me realize I needed to alter what I was doing. I decided to prioritize my wellness and growth. Since then, I\u2019ve been much happier and better integrated. I\u2019m excited to be here and meeting so many amazing people. This might be the honeymoon phase, but I hope it persists and I continue enjoying learning as much as I do now.\nThe Faculty of Medicine is providing matching funding for donations to MD student bursaries, to ensure more students like Chantal receive a robust educational experience, regardless of their background or financial situation. To find out more, please contact medicine.advancement@utoronto.ca. You can also make a donation to the Dean\u2019s Bursary and Excellence Fund online.",

        "article": "By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nREAD MORE: Landmark Belgian Filmmaker Chantal Akerman Dies at 65\nChantal Akerman is gone. Hard to believe.\nI was just explaining to a friend how much I liked her latest film, \u201cNo Home Movie,\u201d which I saw last week at the New York Film Festival. Much of it is a documentary consisting of shots of her aged infirm mother wandering around her very tidy Brussels apartment, as well as shots of these rooms and balcony emptied of people. There are also dialogues between Chantal and her mother, between the mother and her caregiver and between the mother and Chantal\u2019s sister. Chantal descends on her mother from time to time, then goes off on her globe-trotting, film-making ventures, Skyping her mother to keep in touch.\nSigning off from these Skypes, there are multiple declarations of love and kissy-kissy, but when they are together in the same room the tension between mother and daughter is palpable. A sort of comedy unfolds, with Chantal trying to get her mother to tell her stories about her youth, including her years in a concentration camp, meanwhile slipping the noose of her mother\u2019s curiosity about her famous daughter\u2019s life. At one point the mother complains to her younger daughter, \u201cChantal never tells me anything.\u201d The sister replies wryly: \u201cShe never stops talking!\u201d The retort: \u201cBut she never tells me anything important.\u201d\nWe get the sense that Chantal is forever fleeing this comfortable, static, bourgeois mother\u2019s nest, while at the same time desperately dependent on her mother for the maternal warmth she can find nowhere else.\nThe film is slow, annoying\u2014and real. It has more truth in it than 98% of cinema, art or commercial movies. Never mind the baffling cutaways to deserts and unidentified landscapes: are they metaphors? disorienting moves that the experimental filmmaker felt compelled to make? You watch these relatives who love each other but are frustrated in their attempts to connect and think, \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d A slowed-down, plot-less, Belgian version of \u201cLong Day\u2019s Journey Into Night.\u201d\nThe obituary in yesterday\u2019s New York Times noted that Akerman was depressed this past year over her mother\u2019s death, the implication being that suicide may have been the cause of death. So far, that hasn\u2019t been confirmed. Regardless, it\u2019s all there on the screen.\nI thought back to a 1978 feature film of hers, \u201cLes Rendezvous d\u2019Anna.\u201d A woman filmmaker is on tour with her latest work: she takes trains around Europe, stays in hotels, picks up men when she\u2019s lonely, and returns to Paris, where she listens to her answer machine. It\u2019s a bleak picture of a sad, restless life, not especially satisfying as narrative, but touching: you sense Chantal is trying to make a personal statement about what it feels like to be in her skin.\nYou couldn\u2019t get closer to her skin than in \u201cJe Tu Il Elle,\u201d where she rolls around the floor naked eating sugar, then hitchhikes with a trucker who has sex with her. I haven\u2019t seen it in a while, but I remember being impressed with the raw honesty of it. I\u2019m very partial to those early shorts she made in New York, such as \u201cNews from Home\u201d (another mother-daughter dialogue, this time postal) and \u201cHotel Monterey.\u201d\nOf course \u201cJeanne Dielman, 23, quai de commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\u201d was her breakthrough film, her masterpiece, as good as everyone says\u2014a cinematic game-changer, but I am still more drawn to her earlier personal work. There was a time when I looked forward to her next movie more than any other filmmaker\u2019s. In \u201cThe Golden Eighties,\u201d a kooky musical, she tried to spread her wings, with fairly amusing results. Rohmer-esque efforts like \u201cA Couch in New York\u201d were less successful, to my mind. \u201cHistoires d\u2019Amerique\u201d was a clumsy if warm-hearted folkloric exploration of Jews in the Diaspora, with the sort of vignettes she was trying to get her mother to tell.\nShe reached another pinnacle with the magnificent \u201cFrom the East,\u201d another documentary of unblinking looking. In her underrated adaptation of Proust, \u201cLa Captive,\u201d she captured something of her favorite writer\u2019s moody obsessiveness while shrinking his social tapestry.\nAnd so it went: an uneven oeuvre, this one good, that one disappointing, but always making an effort to try something new, to reinvent herself.\nSome words that spring to mind about Akerman\u2019s work are: annoying, irritating, stubborn\u2014but in the best possible sense. She was not obliging, thank God. She was not afraid to try your patience. She would push past the stage when the alleged single \u201cpoint\u201d was made and get you to keep watching, a prisoner of reality as it unfolded.\nShe was exceptional at showing process. The paradox was that so much alienation or depression could coexist with such wonderment and glee at being able to stare at the world as it is. As it was. It no longer is for Chantal. We are the poorer, and will now have to look for her rigorous honesty and generosity elsewhere.\nREAD MORE: Remembering Chantal Akerman: 8 Films Now Streaming Online\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

        "title": "Opinion: A Tale of Two Judges, a Cork Board and the Old Mission Peninsula - Old Mission Gazette",
        "article": "(Editor\u2019s Note: Grant Parsons reflects on the contents of an old cork board in his office and two judges who helped to preserve the rural quality of the Old Mission Peninsula. -jb)\nLast week I started cleaning out my law office, but I was waylaid by an old cork bulletin board behind my door. It was covered with layers of age-yellowed papers, photos, memorabilia. The edges were curled, the ink faded, some torn or indecipherable, some just plain silly, like the Dove chocolate wrapper (\u201cYour future will be \u2026\u201d).\nOld Mission Gazette is Reader Supported.\nClick Here to Keep the Gazette Going.\nSome scraps were pure gold, like the 1982 note from Ramsey Clark when I worked on the Liuzzo trial; a 1999 photo of Dean, Tim, and me; a 2011 Grant Wood-type photo of two parents mourning at their son\u2019s grave; a 1989 hand-written letter from my mom (\u201cDear Grant, your father and I are concerned about large scale nuclear waste dumping and hope you will do something about it\u2026\u201d onto which I had pinned a photocopy of my cheeky response, \u201cMom, got it, it\u2019s on my to-do list for Monday\u2026\u201d).\nSo many stories on that cork board. I\u2019m a sucker for a story. I\u2019m the world\u2019s dawdliest cleaner-outer-thrower-away.\nTwo of the cork board papers especially grabbed my attention. One was a note pinned to a Court Opinion; the other was an email pinned to a Judgment Order. I pulled the pins out, smoothed the curled edges of the papers, and lost myself in the memories \u2013 one from 1990 and the other from 1998. Both gave me a weird sense of deja vu.\nThe 1990 paper was a decision by Judge Mort Forster in the case \u201cProtect the Peninsula v Peninsula Township Board, File No. 88-6390-NZ.\u201d Forster issued a landmark precedent that recognized the legal authority of Old Mission residents \u2013 residents, not just the government \u2013 over land use policy. The case involved a proposed 440-acre development eight miles out on the Peninsula. There had been years of public meetings, revision after revision, zoning amendment, a referendum election, a Special Use Permit (SUP), a lawsuit, and finally a trial.\nProtect the Peninsula hired an expert named Robert Hotaling, known as \u201cthe godfather of Michigan township zoning,\u201d to analyze the development, which he viewed as \u201cleapfrog development\u201d that the township\u2019s infrastructure would not support. After a referendum rejecting the development, the developer submitted an SUP application, which wasn\u2019t subject to referendum. PTP argued in court the SUP was an illegal attempt to evade the will of the people.\nJudge Forster agreed with PTP: \u201cThe Court does agree with the Plaintiff that based on the undisputed history of this proposed development, the township zoning authorities are trying to circumvent the wishes and desires of an overwhelming majority of the electorate and avoid another referendum on the project by utilizing the Special Use procedure \u2026 based on the present record in this case and the lack of legal authority to the contrary, the Court finds that the solution to this issue does not rest with the Court but remains with the electorate and their power to amend the ordinance and elect the people who they feel should administer the ordinance.\u201d\nIt was a clear precedent that recognized the \u201cvox populi,\u201d the public\u2019s voice, in land use policy. Judge Forster cited the long history of the resident\u2019s land use activities shaping Old Mission Peninsula. He reviewed it all \u2013 PTP\u2019s surveys, elections, townhall meetings, past correspondence \u2013 and he threw out the SUP.\nTaped to the 1990 Opinion was a note I sent Forster after he retired. I told him he should be recognized for preserving the most beautiful place on earth. I kept his note back, in which he said it brought tears to his eyes to be remembered that way.\nThere was a second paper, the 1998 Consent Judgment signed by Judge Phil Rodgers, who is generally viewed as the best judge in Grand Traverse County history. He got the township, the winery, and PTP to agree to settle their differences over winery operations. That landmark case, \u201cChateau Operations, LTD., a Michigan corporation, and Robert P. Begin v Peninsula Township File No. 98-017195-CZ,\u201d involved questions about winery operations at Chateau Chantal: events, music, food and alcohol service.\nRodgers convinced the parties to sign a binding, permanent agreement recognizing the township\u2019s authority to limit activities of winery guests, restrict tasting, music, and limit food service \u2013 \u201conly cheese, fruit, bread, or crackers provided at no cost to the persons tasting wine.\u201d\nAfter Judge Rodgers retired, I wrote him an email expressing thoughts similar to what I\u2019d told Judge Forster. Once again, a judge had resolved a lawsuit and saved the Peninsula. He emailed me a gracious reply.\nIt is now 2023. For the past two years, the Wineries of Old Mission Peninsula (WOMP) lawsuit has raged. Neighbors have asked me the same question repeatedly: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, wasn\u2019t this settled long ago?\u201d I say the only thing I can say, \u201cYes, this was settled long ago.\u201d\nTwo judges devoted part of their legal careers to resolving the Peninsula\u2019s land use policy. Forster and Rodgers helped preserve \u2013 maybe the better term is helped create \u2013 what is now recognized as one of the most beautiful agricultural communities in the United States.\nSitting in my quiet office, I threw the papers in the wastebasket. I sat looking at that wastebasket, wondering about it all. I retrieved a scrap and read my own thoughts from long ago, when I was young and believed in simple, straightforward truths, and two judges agreed:\n\u201cYou were a hell of a good judge and a visionary. This City \u2013 and the entire region \u2013 is what it is because you took the time to take little people seriously and uphold what other judges would have considered generic nonsense, the right to vote and shape the community. I want you to know I think you set a standard for citizen suits that has carried forward to this day. I wish you well, and I hope you are enjoying your time, and I want you to know I remember you well.\u201d\nThere are times during this WOMP lawsuit when I have wondered, \u201cWas it worth it? Is it worth it?\u201d Scraps of paper reminded me: The Peninsula was worth it. The Peninsula still is worth it.\nSUPPORT YOUR INDEPENDENT LOCAL NEWSPAPER: I started Old Mission Gazette in 2015 because I felt a calling to provide the Old Mission Peninsula community with local news. After decades of writing for newspapers and magazines like the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Family Circle and Ladies' Home Journal, I really just wanted to write about my own community where I grew up on a cherry farm and raised my own family. So I started my own newspaper.\nBecause Old Mission Gazette is a \"Reader Supported Newspaper\" -- meaning it exists because of your financial support -- I hope you'll consider tossing a few bucks our way if I mention your event, your business, your organization or your news item, or if you simply love reading about what's happening on the OMP. In a time when local news is becoming a thing of the past, supporting an independent community newspaper is more important now than ever.
