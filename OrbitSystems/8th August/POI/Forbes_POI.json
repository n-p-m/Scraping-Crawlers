        "article": "Elly De La Cruz put on a personal Demolition Derby on Monday night in Miami\u2019s loanDepot Park and he wasn\u2019t even driving a car.\nTwo home runs, two doubles, three RBI, three runs scored. What? No stolen base? It was his explosive response to his 0 for 14 when the game began.\nDe La Cruz was the hub cap of a big wheel 15-hit attack, eight for extra bases, that added up to a 10-3 Cincinnati Reds victory over the Miami Marlins.\nAnd De La Cruz continues to etch his name all over the Reds\u2019 record books. He is only the second Reds player since 1901 to have two doubles and two home runs in a game. Paul O\u2019Neill did it in 1991 against the Chicago Cubs in Wrigley Field.\nI got two words for ya: Elly De La Cruz. Must-see TV. pic.twitter.com/QCcFjDTtwC\n\u2014 Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) August 5, 2024\nHis offensive legend continues in his first full MLB season \u2014 20 homers, 57 RBI, a four extra-base hits game and the flashiest oven mitts in the game.\nNot even a broad smile reveals what kind of night De La Cruz has because he goes through life with a perma-press smile.\nAsked why playing Miami brings out his best (9-16, four homers, three doubles), De La Cruz smiled even wider and told Bally Sports Ohio, \u201cAs I always say, it doesn\u2019t matter what team I play against, I\u2019m gonna play hard.\u201d\nTry telling that to Miami.\nAnd about hitting two home runs and not stealing a base, even though he likes stealing bases best of all, he said, \u201cThat felt great ... amazing, amazing.\u201d\nAdd a couple more amazings to that one.\nBy the way, those weren\u2019t the Miami Marlins the Reds crushed. They are the Miami Minnows.\nThe franchise traded nine players at the deadline \u2014 its top three run producers, three of its top four home run hitters and its closer.\nNevertheless, Miami was 9-7 since the All-Star break and just split four games against the Atlanta Braves.\nBut the Reds continued turning loose big sticks, crashing four more home runs, nine in their last three games.\nAnd in four games, three wins, the Reds have scored 30 runs. They are beating up on baseball\u2019s have-nots \u2014 12-2 this season against Miami, Colorado and the Chicago White Sox.\nDe La Cruz, Noelvi Marte and Ty France homered to give the Reds a 7-0 lead in five innings as Reds starter Nick Martinez pitched five scoreless four-hit innings.\nMiami, though, had one big moment.\nJesus Sanchez, the highest paid Miami player at $2.1 million, hit the longest home run in MLB this season.\nHe was the first batter relief pitcher Jakob Junis faced in the sixth inning and Sanchez planted it high into the upper deck, 480 feet from home plate. It was three feet farther than the 477 footer Jorge Solar hit earlier this season.\nAnd Junis gave up three straight singles to open the seventh. One run scored on a double play and another scored on a single by Jonah Bride, cutting Cincinnati\u2019s lead to 7-3.\nThat ended the night for Junis. Buck Farmer replaced him and gave up a quick single, but retired Emmanuel Rivera on a ground ball.\nAt that point, Miami had outhit the Reds, 11-10, but stranded nine runners in seven innings.\nMiami starter Roddery Munoz lasted only 3 2/3 innings, the shortest start of his short career and probably wished his identical twin brother, Rolddy Munoz, had started the game.\nBut Rolddy is pitching in the Atlanta Braves minor league system.\nJonathan India opened the game with an infield hit and De La Cruz picked on the first pitch and lined it so fast into seats that right fielder Sanchez didn\u2019t budge and it was 2-0.\nIndia singled with one out in the third. De La Cruz grounded to the mound and Munoz threw wild to first base. Second baseman Otto Lopez picked it up and threw it into center and India scored from first on the double error. De La Cruz end up on third and scored on TJ Friedl\u2019s sacrifice fly and it was 4-0.\nIt became 6-0 in the fourth when Jake Fraley beat out an infield hit and Marte launched a two-run home run.\nThe lead expanded to 7-0 in fifth. France, 1 for 14 since arriving from Seattle via trade, ripped his first home run.\nAfter Miami made its little run, De La Cruz struck again, a 428-foot home run into the right field upper deck for an 8-3 lead.\nIt was Deuces Wild for the Reds as they scored two runs in the first, third, fourth, eighth and ninth.\nThe two in the ninth came on a two-run double by Jake Fraley after singles by TJ Friedl and France, who followed his home run with a double and a single for a three-hit night.\nAbout the Author",

        "article": "De La Cruz reaches 20/50 mark with massive four-XBH night\nMIAMI -- Elly De La Cruz is no stranger to history. He\u2019s already had some impressive outings in his young career, but on Monday night in Miami, De La Cruz joined two other Cincinnati greats on an exclusive list.\nWith a pair of home runs in the Reds\u2019 10-3 win over the Marlins at loanDepot park, De La Cruz became the third Red to hit 20 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single season, joining Joe Morgan (1973, \u201874, \u201876) and Eric Davis (\u201886, \u201887). De La Cruz is the 14th player in AL/NL history (since 1901) to have a 20/50 season.\nDe La Cruz and Davis are fairly close; the 22-year-old shortstop will often receive a text from Davis after a game, asking how he felt about his performance and whatnot. Now, the pair share company on the same elite list -- a list synonymous with power and speed.\nDe La Cruz said \"it means a lot\" to have the support of Davis, and also another former Reds great who texts with him, Barry Larkin. \"I feel so grateful to be here and to feel so very supported.\u201d\nThe two home runs were just part of De La Cruz\u2019s performance on Monday, as he went 4-for-5 with the two long balls and two doubles to record his first game with four extra-base hits. De La Cruz became just the second Reds player (since at least 1901) to have two doubles and two home runs in a single game. The other player? Paul O\u2019Neill, who accomplished the feat on May 11, 1991 -- 10 years and eight months before De La Cruz was born.\n\u201cIt's really special to watch,\u201d starting pitcher Nick Martinez said. \u201c[Brent] Suter did the math in the dugout, I think [De La Cruz] had a total exit velocity of like 490-something today? He was absolutely crushing the ball.\u201d\nCincinnati\u2019s onslaught began when De La Cruz crushed a two-run homer in the first inning to set the tone. In his next at-bat, De La Cruz jetted around the bases, taking advantage of a pair of errors from the Marlins to turn a measly grounder (which went just four feet) into three bases. He then doubled in the fourth and sixth innings before crushing a solo homer -- his 20th of the season -- in the eighth inning.\nDe La Cruz entered the series after going 0-for-11 against the Giants over the weekend. He was one of a few Reds who has had a small downtick in production of late. But that\u2019s no issue for the youngster, nor the club as a whole. De La Cruz was one of three Reds who went yard against the Marlins, joining Ty France and Noelvi Marte.\n\u201cHe just keeps getting better,\u201d manager David Bell said. \u201cLoves to play. He had a good game the last game on the last road trip, [and] I gave him an off-day the next day -- I think it got him out of his rhythm a little bit and he just kept fighting to find his timing and rhythm.\n\u201cWe knew he'd get it back, and today everything kind of came together for him. So I think the idea now is to hold on to that, [and] we should be able to do that. He just works so hard and plays hard every single day and clearly helped us win the game tonight.\u201d\nNow, circling back to that 20/50 mark; De La Cruz is just the third player to achieve the feat in their age 22 season -- the D-backs\u2019 Corbin Carroll did so last season -- and is the youngest primary shortstop (at least 50% of games at the position) to reach the mark. Hanley Ramirez, who went 29/51 in 2007, is the only other shortstop to do so, and that was his age 23 season.\nSo will his manager ever get tired of seeing De La Cruz continue to make history?\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Bell said with a laugh. \u201cThere's a lot more to come.\n\u201c... It's fun to watch him every day. But it does start with his approach to how he's working and continuing to get better, [he] wants to be on the field. And he\u2019s a great teammate. Teammates love him -- that makes it more enjoyable to watch him play. not only is he a great player, but he's doing all the other things.\u201d",

        "article": "Elly De La Cruz is a superstar. And in his own words, he\u2019s the most exciting player in baseball \u2013 as he told Jeff Passan. At least on Monday night he backed that up as he had four extra-base hits that included two home runs as the Cincinnati Reds crushed the Miami Marlins 10-3 to open up their 4-game series down in Florida.\nCincinnati wasted next to no time in taking the lead on Monday night. Jonathan India led off the game with a single and then got to trot home when Elly De La Cruz hit a laser over the Reds bullpen for a 2-run homer. Two innings later they would pad that lead after another single by India and then De La Cruz forcing a throwing error that led to a second throwing error and brought India around to score. TJ Friedl capped the inning with a sacrifice fly as Cincinnati built a 4-0 lead.\nNick Martinez, who was starting on short rest after making a relief appearance last series, cruised through the Marlins lineup. He was about as pitch efficient as possible and his offense just kept playing add on for him. In the top of the 4th inning Noelvi Marte made it 6-0 with an opposite field 2-run homer. An inning later it was Ty France coming through with a solo shot that extended the lead to 7-0.\nMartinez would return to the mound for the 5th and he had to work around a single, but he did just that to complete his night and exit the game with his team up by a touchdown. Jakob Junis took over in the 6th and gave up a 480-foot moonshot to Jesus Sanchez as the Marlins got on the board to cut the lead to six runs.\nMiami took it to Jakob Junis again in the 7th inning. They put together three straight singles to load the bases. Junis got a grounder up the middle that saw Elly De La Cruz make a sliding stop on after a weird hop off of the mound and turn it into a double play, but brought in a Marlins run. A 4th single in the inning followed and brought in another run as the Reds lead was cut to 7-3. That was it for Junis as Cincinnati turned the game over to Buck Farmer with two outs. He\u2019d give up another single, but get out of the inning with no further damage.\nIn the top of the 8th inning the Reds got one of those runs back. Elly De La Cruz unloaded on an 0-1 pitch from Shaun Anderson, hitting it 428 feet into the seats for his second homer of the day and his 4th extra-base hit of the game.\nThe Reds played add on in the top of the 9th. After loading the bases, Jake Fraley doubled down the left field line to plate two runs and make it 10-3. Justin Wilson came into the game for the final three outs and held that score as the visiting team grabbed the first game of the series with a blowout win.\nKey Moment of the Game\nNoelvi Marte\u2019s 2-run home run in the 4th inning. That put the game out of slam range and it did so early on.\nNotes Worth Noting\nElly De La Cruz had four hits and 12 total bases. He raised his OPS 37 points in this game. He also hasn\u2019t struck out in the last three games.\nTy France had three hits, including a double and a homer.\nNick Martinez, who has struggled in the role as a starter this season, threw five shutout innings with five strikeouts as he lowered his ERA on the season to 3.43.\nThe Reds had 15 hits on the night, walking three times and striking out just four times.\nUp Next for the Cincinnati Reds\nCincinnati Reds vs Miami Marlins\nTuesday August 6th, 6:40pm ET\nNick Lodolo (8-4, 3.99 ERA) vs Max Meyer (2-1, 3.81 ERA)",

        "article": "Elly De La Cruz Fills Up the History Books in Cincinnati Reds Win on Monday\nThe Cincinnati Reds dismantled the Miami Marlins on Monday night, 10-3, at loanDepot park in Miami.\nWith the win, the Reds are now 54-58 on the season. The loss drops the Marlins to 42-71. Unfortunately, the Reds are one of the most disappointing teams in baseball. With a young core of exciting infielders, the Reds went out and added to their bullpen and rotation this offseason, plus they signed Jeimer Candelario.\nBut the season has gone off the rails due to an all-season injury to Matt McLain, a PED suspension for Noelvi Marte and what was a slow start to the year for Candelario.\nWhat hasn't been disappointing is the play of superstar infielder Elly De La Cruz, who was named to his first All-Star team this summer. In the win on Monday, he went 4-for-5 with three runs scored, three RBI, two doubles, and two homers.\nThat stat line helped him fill up the history books in multiple ways. First, according to Sarah Langs of MLB.com:\nat 22 years & 207 days old, Elly De La Cruz is the 6th-youngest player with 2+ 2B & 2+ HR in a game since at least 1901, older than only:\n7/1/03 Miguel Cabrera: 20y, 74d\n6/19/29 Mel Ott: 20y, 109d\n6/24/36 Joe DiMaggio: 21y, 212d\n9/7/89 Gregg Jefferies: 22y, 37d\n5/26/28 Freddie Lindstrom: 22y, 187d\nAnd this one, also from Langs:\nElly De La Cruz with the 20th 4-XBH game by a Reds player since at least 1901\nat 22 years & 207 days old, he\u00e2s the youngest Reds player to do it in that span\nDe La Cruz is now hitting .261 this season with 20 homers, 48 RBI and 57 stolen bases. He has posted an .843 OPS.\nThe Reds will play the Marlins again on Tuesday.\nFollow Fastball on FanNation on social media\nContinue to follow our Fastball on FanNation coverage on social media by liking us on\u00c2 Facebook\u00c2 and by following us on Twitter\u00c2 @FastballFN.",

        "article": "Joe Burrow reacts to shockingly low ranking on NFL Top 100 list\nIn a recent ranking of the NFL's Top 100 players, as voted on by the players themselves, Cincinnati Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow came in at No. 39 overall behind other, less accomplished quarterbacks like Tua Tagovailoa and Jordan Love. The ranking is questionable, to say the least.\nListen, it's fair to have concerns about Burrow's ability to avoid injuries and stay out on the field, as he has suffered two season-ending injuries in his four seasons in the NFL.\nBut, when Burrow is healthy -- as he hopefully will be moving forward --he's arguably the second-best quarterback in the entire NFL behind Kansas City Chiefs signal-caller Patrick Mahomes and a proven playoff performer who has already led Cincinnati to a Super Bowl and two AFC championship games.\nTagovailoa, on the other hand, has a 0-1 career playoff record, while Jordan Love has one playoff victory to his name. Neither guy is better than Burrow, even considering the fact that he's coming off of a wrist surgery.\nBurrow shares his thoughts on the low ranking\nClearly, we're fired up about Burrow's low ranking on the list. But what about the man himself? The Bengals star QB recently shared his thoughts regarding his place on the Top 100 list, and he kept it pretty diplomatic, acknowledging that he needs to go out there and again prove how good he is in 2024.\n\u00e2I think I\u00e2m obviously better than that,\u00e2 Burrow said of the ranking. \u00e2But when you\u00e2re not playing \u00e2\u00a6 I didn\u00e2t have exactly a season that would have put me any higher than that. When you\u00e2re hurt, you really can\u00e2t complain much about any accolades or anything, until you go out and prove yourself again.\u00e2\nWhile the perceived slight might serve as a temporary motivator, Burrow doesn't need any external motivation to be at his best out on the field.\n\"Maybe it motivates you for a day,\" Burrow said. \"... I don't think you can continuously rely on that kind of motivation. You have to be intrinsically motivated to play at the level I want to play at and be as good as I want to be.\"\nBurrow is better than the 39th-best player in the NFL. We know that, and he knows that. But, he's taking the right approach to the ranking; not letting it get to him, while preparing to remind everyone just how good he is.",

        "title": "Three topics with Bengals OC Dan Pitcher: Joe Burrow\u2019s progress, Ja\u2019Marr Chase\u2019s absence - The Athletic",
        "article": "CINCINNATI \u2014 Dan Pitcher had just completed his ninth training camp practice as offensive coordinator of the Bengals.\nThe 93-degree heat still stifling while players finished up work after practice, Pitcher was still in processing mode. He\u2019d seen Joe Burrow drop a red zone dime to Trenton Irwin in the back corner for a touchdown. He again walked away impressed by the Cincinnati defensive communication making life hard on his group. And he had another batch of plays and developments to digest with his first regular-season game as coordinator now five weeks away.\nAdvertisement\nHe\u2019s overseeing an offensive transition packed with new pieces, tinkering with change and littered with potential.\nI caught up with him through drops of sweat beads to touch on his view of how critical topics of the offense\u2019s development are unfolding over two weeks.\nTopic 1: Gauging Joe Burrow\u2019s performance\nBackground: Burrow is returning from wrist surgery, participated in OTAs and only taken two proactive limited practices through the first two weeks of this camp. He\u2019s yet to throw an interception in 11-on-11 (only one in seven-on-seven) uncorked his most impressive ball of training camp this past weekend, hitting Shedrick Jackson 50 yards down the field while on the run outside the pocket.\nHow does he view his progress and comfort compared to the expectations? What have been the most encouraging elements?\nPitcher: \u201cHe\u2019s been good overall. It was obviously nice to see him uncork a couple of those long ones on the run the other day. I think you\u2019ve seen all the deep range that he needs. I think the accuracy has been there. He\u2019s continuing to get that timing down a little bit, if there\u2019s anything that\u2019s popped up here and there, it might just be getting that part all the way back to certain guys. But he looks like he\u2019s gonna be able do everything we need him to do to win a whole lot of football games.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nAmarius Mims becoming the biggest story in Bengals camp\nTiming with new targets will be a story every August. Most plays in camp Burrow drops back to see some combination of three second-year players who didn\u2019t start last season (WR Andrei Iosivas, WR Charlie Jones, RB Chase Brown), a new tight end (Mike Gesicki) and running back (Zack Moss). Timing being a regular issue is merely part of the process this time of year?\nPitcher: \u201cWe got new guys, many of whom are showing some really good things, but it\u2019s about learning body language and learning just how fast a certain guy is out of this break versus this guy. You know, this guy likes to turn in versus this look, this guy turns out. We afford our skill players \u2014 at least the ones that have proven that they deserve it \u2014 we afford them some license to do things that make sense and it\u2019s really just that this time of year is about us figuring out what those are and making sure we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d\nTopic 2: What is going to happen in the tight end room?\nBackground: Drew Sample and Tanner Hudson return from last season, but Gesicki along with draft picks Erick All, Tanner McLachlan and undrafted free-agent Cam Grandy all make for a packed battle for playing time and roster spots. Plus, Gesicki and Hudson are primarily receiving threats and open up a new set of possibilities for usage of the position in the Bengals\u2019 offense.\nAdvertisement\nHow much do you know what\u2019s going on in the tight end room and how much of what\u2019s happening is tinkering with possibilities?\nPitcher: \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of exploration still going on. It\u2019s obviously nice to see Erick out there as he works his way back. That\u2019s been exciting because I think he\u2019s got some really high-end ability once he\u2019s able to put it all together and he\u2019s a long way out, but he\u2019s given us all the indication that he\u2019s gonna get there eventually.\nFree, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.\nFree, daily NFL updates direct to your inbox.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a pleasure when Drew, Tanner and Mike are just, they all think the game like a quarterback. And so that\u2019s really fun because they come back and you can give them a coaching point and they know exactly what you\u2019re talking about and you can just see it in their eyes like, \u2018Oh, yeah, yeah, I got you.\u2019 So it\u2019s, it\u2019s a fun room, I think obviously however the workload ends up being divvied up that has not yet been decided, but we feel good about those guys.\u201d\nGesicki, in particular, hasn\u2019t been as noticeable in 11-on-11 (also day to day with tightness, according to Zac Taylor) and still working in the aforementioned timing development aspect. How much is his involvement about building his comfort with creativity and connecting with Burrow?\nPitcher: \u201cMike\u2019s an example of a guy who, he\u2019s been around a long time who deserves that trust. You know, because with that license comes responsibility that you\u2019re gonna do it when the defense dictates, you should do it and not at other times when you should just run the route like it\u2019s run on the paper. And that takes awareness so Mike\u2019s one of those guys for sure that has that respect from us and should be allowed some creativity from time to time.\u201d\nTopic 3: How do you implement new packages for Ja\u2019Marr Chase without him practicing?\nAmid contract-extension discussions, Chase has yet to participate in any of the 10 Cincinnati practices or the offseason program. Pitcher has said there are new wrinkles he\u2019s implemented in the scheme, and as you would expect, many involve new ways to amplify the Bengals\u2019 star receiver.\nHow do you approach any new usage of Chase without him practicing? Is it just film work, running it with other players, talking to him about it?\nGO DEEPER\nBengals trend report: Highlighting who positioned themselves best as pads come on\nPitcher: \u201cI would say we\u2019re still doing a good job of really conceptually practicing all the things that we planned to practice from a scheme standpoint. Then I think you just, when you do have Ja\u2019Marr available to you, you just may amend things, formation and motion-wise to get him into some of the spots that are the primary reasons and these concepts that we\u2019ve been working on.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s not like there is a new offense to learn or any concern about chemistry with the quarterback, so I imagine that makes it fairly easy?\nPitcher: \u201cAgain, we haven\u2019t revolutionized our offense. We\u2019ve added some wrinkles and we\u2019re working on those right now. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all gonna be about putting our guys in a position to have success. Ja\u2019Marr is front and center in that. He\u2019ll get the work once we get him and we\u2019ll move on from there.\u201d\n(Top photo of Joe Burrow: Albert Cesare / The Enquirer / USA Today)",

        "title": "Justin Fields Takes Starting Reps for Steelers With Russell Wilson Out | Around the AFC North",
        "article": "Pittsburgh Steelers: Justin Fields Shines While Russell Wilson Is Hampered\nJustin Fields is having the kind of start to training camp he wanted, while Russell Wilson is not.\nFields has been taking first-team reps for the Steelers since Russell Wilson suffered a calf injury on the first day of camp. Wilson has been at camp, but the Steelers have been cautious with his workload so far.\nThere has been no indication from Head Coach Mike Tomlin that Wilson won't be the starting quarterback Week 1. However, Fields has played well according to new Offensive Coordinator Arthur Smith, who is intrigued by Fields' dual threat as a runner and thrower.\n\"He's a dangerous football player with the ball in his hands,\" Smith said via Gerry Dulac of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"It allows you to get creative. Maybe you change up a little bit of a defensive game plan for him. Certainly, he adds a different element.\"\nSmith has challenged Fields to take shots downfield and avoid settling for safe throws. George Pickens and Van Jefferson have made several deep connections with Fields during practices.\n\"Sometimes we're asking him to be aggressive, even in 7-on-7. You have to try to in practice,\" Smith said. \"Nobody wants to see negative plays or if he just checks down. We got to see what he can really do and what he can see in the pocket and all that stuff. Him having more reps is accelerating that process.\"\nCincinnati Bengals: Joe Burrow Looks 'Really Good' in Bengals' Camp\nJoe Burrow is also benefiting greatly from getting reps in camp.\nWhen Burrow entered the league in 2020, the Bengals' training camp wasn't normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Burrow began training camp still recovering from a season-ending torn ACL. In 2022, he had appendicitis in camp that interfered with his preparation, and last year Burrow injured his right calf on the second day of camp.\nThis has been Burrow's first \"normal\" training camp, and Head Coach Zac Taylor thinks that's important, even for a quarterback of Burrow's caliber.\n\"He did not practice a day in August last year,\" Taylor said via Dan Graziano of ESPN. \"He practiced two days in July, and then he came back the game week of Cleveland. That was his first real practice. So to be able to get however many practices we're getting in August is just such a game-changer in terms of the comfort of moving in the pocket and the chemistry with the receivers and seeing these coverages and communication. It's just night and day when you're standing in the back talking it through with guys versus actually doing it. The comfort level is on a whole different level.\"\nTaylor said Burrow looked fully recovered from last year's season-ending injury to his throwing wrist. However, they'll be some off days planned for Burrow to be safe.\n\"He looks really good,\" Taylor said. \"He looks like the guy that I know. Now it's just my job to manage him early in camp, even when he says, 'I feel great, I want to go.'\"\nCleveland Browns: Jerry Jeudy Finding Quick Chemistry With Deshaun Watson\nWide receiver Jeudy missed mandatory minicamp in June and the first few days of training camp with an undisclosed injury. However, since returning to practice, Jeudy has been a consistent target for quarterback Deshaun Watson and the two have established quick chemistry.\n\"Deshaun throw a nice ball,\" Jeudy said via Chris Easterling of the Akron Beacon Journal. \"I've been watching Deshaun since he was in college, he always threw a nice ball. I'm excited to see what we do this year.\"\nThe Browns traded fifth and sixth-round draft picks to the Denver Broncos in March to acquire Jeudy to join Amari Cooper and Elijah Moore in their wide receiver rotation. Jeudy was the 15th overall pick in the 2020, but he never cracked 1,000 yards during his four seasons in Denver playing with six different starting quarterbacks.\nJeudy's best season in Denver came in 2022 (67 catches, 972 yards, six touchdowns) and he's only 25 years old. Head Coach Kevin Stefanski believes Jeudy's best seasons are ahead.\n\"Jerry's been a really fun addition to this group,\" Stefanski said. \"I think he does an outstanding job in the meeting room, on the practice field, has a great attitude, works very hard. Obviously, we're excited to get him back out there and full speed and working with his teammates, but he fits in with us how we operate. We're excited to have him.\"",

        "article": "Joe Burrow shares unique reason why he chose to learn piano this offseason\nJoe Burrow has gotten a lot of attention for changing his hairstyle, but one of the more interesting things he did in the offseason was learn how to play the piano. When speaking to reporters last week, the star Cincinnati Bengals quarterback explained why playing the piano during the offseason was good for him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to learn. I thought it helped my dexterity, coming back from injury,\u201d Burrow said. \u201cSo I thought it was a good time to learn.\u201d\nA reporter then asked Burrow what kind of songs he knew how to play on the piano. \u201cI got three songs that I think I can play right now pretty confidently,\u201d the former LSU Tigers quarterback revealed. \u201cSo we\u2019re still working on that.\u201d\nBurrow is working his way back to the field after missing the final seven games of the season due to a wrist injury. In the early stages of training camp, Burrow revealed that his wrist was fine and he could make all the necessary throws.\n\u201cI still have some throws, \u2018Well, what did that look like?\u2019 Usually, it goes where I want it to, but sometimes it doesn\u2019t spin the way I want it to, so we\u2019re still working through that,\u201d Burrow said. \u201cBut I feel really good about where I\u2019m at. I feel like I kind of figured something out towards the end of the practice there in individuals. I\u2019m looking forward to exploring that more.\u201d\nJoe Burrow looking to get some work in during the preseason\nIn the last two preseasons, Burrow has dealt with injuries, preventing him from getting any work done during that time. And with the Bengals starting the season 0-2 in both years, the plan for Burrow is to see limited action during the preseason.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just different when you go warm up knowing you\u2019re going to play,\u201d Burrow said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best way to go about it. This year we\u2019ll try it out. I think in order for us to be at our best at the beginning of the year, I think we kind of need that. That\u2019s something we wanted to do in years past and we haven\u2019t been able to do. I\u2019m excited to get that done this year.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see (if it prevents a slow start). That\u2019s a question that\u2019s to be determined. I think we\u2019re thinking about it the right way. I think we\u2019re trying new things to try to help those slow starts and getting off to faster starts, putting us in a better position at the midway point of the season. I do think that it will help, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d",
